In this paper, we attempt to explain the
emergence of the linguistic diversity that
exists across the consonant inventories of
some of the major language families of the
world through a complex network based
growth model. There is only a single pa-
rameter for this model that is meant to
introduce a small amount of randomness
in the otherwise preferential attachment
based growth process. The experiments
with this model parameter indicates that
the choice of consonants among the lan-
guages within a family are far more pref-
erential than it is across the families. Fur-
thermore, our observations indicate that
this parameter might bear a correlation
with the period of existence of the lan-
guage families under investigation. These
findings lead us to argue that preferential
attachement seems to be an appropriate
high level abstraction for language acqui-
sition and change.
