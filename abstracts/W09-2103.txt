 
The field of intelligent tutoring systems has 
seen many successes in recent years.  A 
significant remaining challenge is the 
automatic creation of corpus-based tutorial 
dialogue management models.  This paper 
reports on early work toward this goal.  We 
identify tutorial dialogue modes in an 
unsupervised fashion using hidden Markov 
models (HMMs) trained on input 
sequences of manually-labeled dialogue 
acts and adjacency pairs.  The two best-fit 
HMMs are presented and compared with 
respect to the dialogue structure they 
suggest; we also discuss potential uses of 
the methodology for future work.
