This paper presents our approach to the 2013
Native Language Identification shared task,
which is based on machine learning methods
that work at the character level. More pre-
cisely, we used several string kernels and a
kernel based on Local Rank Distance (LRD).
Actually, our best system was a kernel combi-
nation of string kernel and LRD. While string
kernels have been used before in text analysis
tasks, LRD is a distance measure designed to
work on DNA sequences. In this work, LRD is
applied with success in native language iden-
tification.
Finally, the Unibuc team ranked third in the
closed NLI Shared Task. This result is more
impressive if we consider that our approach
is language independent and linguistic theory
neutral.
