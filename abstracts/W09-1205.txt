Motivated by the large number of languages
(seven) and the short development time (two
months) of the 2009 CoNLL shared task, we
exploited latent variables to avoid the costly
process of hand-crafted feature engineering,
allowing the latent variables to induce features
from the data. We took a pre-existing gener-
ative latent variable model of joint syntactic-
semantic dependency parsing, developed for
English, and applied it to six new languages
with minimal adjustments. The parser?s ro-
bustness across languages indicates that this
parser has a very general feature set. The
parser?s high performance indicates that its la-
tent variables succeeded in inducing effective
features. This system was ranked third overall
with a macro averaged F1 score of 82.14%,
only 0.5% worse than the best system.
