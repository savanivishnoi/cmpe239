This paper briefly reports our system for the
SemEval-2013 Task 2: sentiment analysis in
Twitter. We first used an SVM classifier with
a wide range of features, including bag of
word features (unigram, bigram), POS fea-
tures, stylistic features, readability scores and
other statistics of the tweet being analyzed,
domain names, abbreviations, emoticons in
the Twitter text. Then we investigated the ef-
fectiveness of these features. We also used
character n-gram language models to address
the problem of high lexical variation in Twit-
ter text and combined the two approaches to
obtain the final results. Our system is robust
and achieves good performance on the Twitter
test data as well as the SMS test data.
