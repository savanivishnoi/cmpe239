The DDIExtraction 2013 task in the SemEval
conference concerns the detection of drug
names and statements of drug-drug interac-
tions (DDI) from text. Extraction of DDIs
is important for providing up-to-date knowl-
edge on adverse interactions between co-
administered drugs. We apply the machine
learning based Turku Event Extraction Sys-
tem to both tasks. We evaluate three fea-
ture sets, syntactic features derived from deep
parsing, enhanced optionally with features de-
rived from DrugBank or from both DrugBank
and MetaMap. TEES achieves F-scores of
60% for the drug name recognition task and
59% for the DDI extraction task.
