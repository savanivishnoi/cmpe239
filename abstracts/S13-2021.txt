This paper presents our approach used for
cross-lingual textual entailment task (task 8)
organized within SemEval 2013. Cross-
lingual textual entailment (CLTE) tries to de-
tect the entailment relationship between two
text fragments in different languages. We
solved this problem in three steps. Firstly,
we use a off-the-shelf machine translation
(MT) tool to convert the two input texts into
the same language. Then after performing a
text preprocessing, we extract multiple feature
types with respect to surface text and gram-
mar. We also propose novel feature types
regarding to sentence difference and seman-
tic similarity based on our observations in the
preliminary experiments. Finally, we adopt a
multiclass SVM algorithm for classification.
The results on the cross-lingual data collec-
tions provided by SemEval 2013 show that (1)
we can build portable and effective systems
across languages using MT and multiple ef-
fective features; (2) our systems achieve the
best results among the participants on two test
datasets, i.e., FRA-ENG and DEU-ENG.
