Most research related to unithood were con-
ducted as part of a larger effort for the deter-
mination of termhood. Consequently, nov-
elties are rare in this small sub-field of term
extraction. In addition, existing work were
mostly empirically motivated and derived.
We propose a new probabilistically-derived
measure, independent of any influences of
termhood, that provides dedicated measures
to gather linguistic evidence from parsed
text and statistical evidence from Google
search engine for the measurement of unit-
hood. Our comparative study using 1, 825
test cases against an existing empirically-
derived function revealed an improvement in
terms of precision, recall and accuracy.
