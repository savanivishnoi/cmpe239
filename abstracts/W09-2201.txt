We consider semi-supervised learning of
information extraction methods, especially
for extracting instances of noun categories
(e.g., ?athlete,? ?team?) and relations (e.g.,
?playsForTeam(athlete,team)?). Semi-
supervised approaches using a small number
of labeled examples together with many un-
labeled examples are often unreliable as they
frequently produce an internally consistent,
but nevertheless incorrect set of extractions.
We propose that this problem can be over-
come by simultaneously learning classifiers
for many different categories and relations
in the presence of an ontology defining
constraints that couple the training of these
classifiers. Experimental results show that
simultaneously learning a coupled collection
of classifiers for 30 categories and relations
results in much more accurate extractions
than training classifiers individually.
