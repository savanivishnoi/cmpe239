We present a new approach to automatic
summarization based on neural nets, called
NetSum. We extract a set of features from
each sentence that helps identify its impor-
tance in the document. We apply novel
features based on news search query logs
and Wikipedia entities. Using the RankNet
learning algorithm, we train a pair-based
sentence ranker to score every sentence in
the document and identify the most impor-
tant sentences. We apply our system to
documents gathered from CNN.com, where
each document includes highlights and an
article. Our system significantly outper-
forms the standard baseline in the ROUGE-1
measure on over 70% of our document set.
