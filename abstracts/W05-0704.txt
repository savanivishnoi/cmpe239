 
This paper explores the effect of 
improved morphological analysis, 
particularly context sensitive morphology, 
on monolingual Arabic Information 
Retrieval (IR).  It also compares the effect 
of context sensitive morphology to non-
context sensitive morphology.  The results 
show that better coverage and improved 
correctness have a dramatic effect on IR 
effectiveness and that context sensitive 
morphology further improves retrieval 
effectiveness, but the improvement is not 
statistically significant. Furthermore, the 
improvement obtained by the use of 
context sensitive morphology over the use 
of light stemming was not significantly 
significant.
