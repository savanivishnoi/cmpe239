The lack of large amounts of readily available, explicitly represented
knowledge has long been recognized as a barrier to applications requir-
ing semantic knowledge such as machine translation and question an-
swering. This problem is analogous to that facing machine translation
decades ago, where one proposed solution was to use human translators
to post-edit automatically produced, low quality translations rather than
expect a computer to independently create high-quality translations. This
paper describes an attempt at implementing a semantic parser that takes
unrestricted English text, uses publically available computational linguis-
tics tools and lexical resources and as output produces semantic triples
which can be used in a variety of tasks such as generating knowledge
bases, providing raw material for question answering systems, or creating
RDF structures. We describe the TEXTCAP system, detail the semantic
triple representation it produces, illustrate step by step how TEXTCAP
processes a short text, and use its results on unseen texts to discuss the
amount of post-editing that might be realistically required.
