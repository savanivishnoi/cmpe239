  
The development of spoken dialogue 
systems is often limited by the performance 
of their speech recognition component. The 
impact of speech recognition errors on 
dialogue systems is often studied at the 
global level of task completion. In this 
paper, we carry an empirical study on the 
consequences of speech recognition errors 
on a fully-implemented dialogue prototype, 
based on a speech acts formalisms. We 
report the impact of speech recognition 
errors on speech act identification and 
discuss how standard control mechanisms 
can participate to robustness by assisting the 
user in repairing the consequences of speech 
recognition errors.
