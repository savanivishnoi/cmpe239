This paper describes an effort to perform Na-
tive Language Identification (NLI) using ma-
chine learning on a large amount of lexical
features. The features were collected from se-
quences and collocations of bare word forms,
suffixes and character n-grams amounting to
a feature set of several hundred thousand fea-
tures. These features were used to train a lin-
ear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
for predicting the native language category.
