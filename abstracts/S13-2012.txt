This paper describes a complete event/time
ordering system that annotates raw text with
events, times, and the ordering relations be-
tween them at the SemEval-2013 Task 1. Task
1 is a unique challenge because it starts from
raw text, rather than pre-annotated text with
known events and times. A working system
first identifies events and times, then identifies
which events and times should be ordered, and
finally labels the ordering relation between
them. We present a split classifier approach
that breaks the ordering tasks into smaller de-
cision points. Experiments show that more
specialized classifiers perform better than few
joint classifiers. The NavyTime system ranked
second both overall and in most subtasks like
event extraction and relation labeling.
