This paper describes the system developed by
the Serendio team for the SemEval-2013 Task
2 competition (Task A). We use a lexicon
based approach for discovering sentiments.
Our lexicon is built from the Serendio tax-
onomy. The Serendio taxonomy consists of
positive, negative, negation, stop words and
phrases. A typical tweet contains word varia-
tions, emoticons, hashtags etc. We use prepro-
cessing steps such as stemming, emoticon de-
tection and normalization, exaggerated word
shortening and hashtag detection. After the
preprocessing, the lexicon-based system clas-
sifies the tweets as positive or negative based
on the contextual sentiment orientation of the
words. Our system yields an F-score of 0.8004
on the test dataset.
