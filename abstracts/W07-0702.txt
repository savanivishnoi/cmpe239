Combinatorial Categorial Grammar (CCG)
supertags present phrase-based machine
translation with an opportunity to access
rich syntactic information at a word level.
The challenge is incorporating this informa-
tion into the translation process. Factored
translation models allow the inclusion of su-
pertags as a factor in the source or target lan-
guage. We show that this results in an im-
provement in the quality of translation and
that the value of syntactic supertags in flat
structured phrase-based models is largely
due to better local reorderings.
