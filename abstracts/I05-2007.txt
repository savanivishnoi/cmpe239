 
We describe a resource-based method 
of morphological annotation of written 
Korean text. Korean is an agglutinative 
language. The output of our system is a 
graph of morphemes annotated with 
accurate linguistic information. The 
language resources used by the system 
can be easily updated, which allows us-
ers to control the evolution of the per-
formances of the system. We show that 
morphological annotation of Korean 
text can be performed directly with a 
lexicon of words and without morpho-
logical rules.
