 
Our research aim here is to build a CLIR 
system that works for a language pair 
with poor resources where the source 
language (e.g. Indonesian) has limited 
language resources. Our Indonesian-
Japanese CLIR system employs the 
existing Japanese IR system, and we 
focus our research on the Indonesian-
Japanese query translation. There are two 
problems in our limited resource query 
translation: the OOV problem and the 
translation ambiguity. The OOV problem 
is handled using target language?s 
resources (English-Japanese dictionary 
and Japanese proper name dictionary). 
The translation ambiguity is handled 
using a Japanese monolingual corpus in 
our translation filtering. We select the 
final translation set using the mutual 
information score and the TF?IDF score. 
The result on NTCIR 3 (NII-NACSIS 
Test Collection for IR Systems) Web 
Retrieval Task shows that the translation 
method achieved a higher IR score than 
the transitive machine translation (using 
Kataku (Indonesian-English) and 
Babelfish/ Excite (English-Japanese) 
engine) result. The best result achieved 
about 49% of the monolingual retrieval.
