 
We have developed a computational model of the process 
of describing the layout of an apartment or house, a 
much-studied iscourse task first characterized 
linguistically by Linde (1974). The model is embodied 
in a program, APT, that can reproduce segments of 
actual tape-recorded descriptions, using organizational 
and discourse strategies derived through analysis of our 
corpus.
