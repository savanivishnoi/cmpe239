 
Recent studies on word sense induction 
(WSI) mainly concentrate on European 
languages, Chinese word sense induction 
is becoming popular as it presents a new 
challenge to WSI. In this paper, we 
propose a feature-based approach using 
the spectral clustering algorithm to this 
problem. We also compare various 
clustering algorithms and similarity 
metrics. Experimental results show that 
our system achieves promising 
performance in F-score.
