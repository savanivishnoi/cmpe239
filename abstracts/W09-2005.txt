creativeness / a pleasing field / of bloom
Word associations are an important element
of linguistic creativity. Traditional lexical
knowledge bases such as WordNet formalize
a limited set of systematic relations among
words, such as synonymy, polysemy and hy-
pernymy. Such relations maintain their sys-
tematicity when composed into lexical chains.
We claim that such relations cannot explain
the type of lexical associations common in
poetic text. We explore in this paper the
usage of Word Association Norms (WANs)
as an alternative lexical knowledge source
to analyze linguistic computational creativity.
We specifically investigate the Haiku poetic
genre, which is characterized by heavy re-
liance on lexical associations. We first com-
pare the density of WAN-based word asso-
ciations in a corpus of English Haiku po-
ems to that of WordNet-based associations as
well as in other non-poetic genres. These
experiments confirm our hypothesis that the
non-systematic lexical associations captured
in WANs play an important role in poetic text.
We then present Gaiku, a system to automat-
ically generate Haikus from a seed word and
using WAN-associations. Human evaluation
indicate that generated Haikus are of lesser
quality than human Haikus, but a high propor-
tion of generated Haikus can confuse human
readers, and a few of them trigger intriguing
reactions.
