Automatic assessment of reading ability
builds on applying speech recognition tools
to oral reading, measuring words correct per
minute. This work looks at more fine-grained
analysis that accounts for effects of prosodic
context using a large corpus of read speech
from a literacy study. Experiments show that
lower-level readers tend to produce relatively
more lengthening on words that are not likely
to be final in a prosodic phrase, i.e. in less
appropriate locations. The results have impli-
cations for automatic assessment of text dif-
ficulty in that locations of atypical prosodic
lengthening are indicative of difficult lexical
items and syntactic constructions.
