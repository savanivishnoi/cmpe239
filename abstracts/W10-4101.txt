 
The authors propose that we need some 
change for the current technology in 
Chinese word segmentation. We should 
have separate and different phases in the 
so-called segmentation. First of all, we 
need to limit segmentation only to the 
segmentation of Chinese characters in-
stead of the so-called Chinese words. In 
character segmentation, we will extract 
all the information of each character. 
Then we start a phase called Chinese 
morphological processing (CMP). The 
first step of CMP is to do a combination 
of the separate characters and is then fol-
lowed by post-segmentation processing, 
including all sorts of repetitive structures, 
Chinese-style abbreviations, recognition 
of pseudo-OOVs and their processing, 
etc. The most part of post-segmentation 
processing may have to be done by some 
rule-based sub-routines, thus we need 
change the current corpus-based meth-
odology by merging with rule-based 
technique.
