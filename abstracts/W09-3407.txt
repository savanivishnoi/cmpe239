 
Machine transliteration has a number of ap-
plications in a variety of natural language 
processing related tasks such as machine 
translation, information retrieval and ques-
tion-answering. For automated learning of 
machine transliteration, a large parallel cor-
pus of names in two scripts is required. In 
this paper we present a simple yet powerful 
method for automatic mining of Hindi-
English names from a parallel corpus. An 
average 93% precision and 85% recall is 
achieved in mining of proper names. The 
method works even with a small corpus. We 
compare our results with Giza++ word 
alignment tool that yields 30% precision and 
63% recall on the same corpora. We also 
demonstrate that this very method of name 
mining works for other Indian languages as 
well.
