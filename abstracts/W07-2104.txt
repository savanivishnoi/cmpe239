In this paper we describe our participation in
the SemEval 2007 Web People Search task.
Our main aim in participating was to adapt
language modeling tools for the task, and to
experiment with various document represen-
tations. Our main finding is that single pass
clustering, using title, snippet and body to
represent documents, is the most effective
setting.
