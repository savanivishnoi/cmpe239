 
The unique properties of lree-adjoining grammars (TAG) 
present a challenge for the application of 'FAGs beyond 
the limited confines of syntax, for instance, to the task of 
semantic interpretation or automatic translation of nat- 
ural h'mguage. We present a variant of "FAGs, called 
synchronous TAGs, which chmacterize correspondences 
between languages. "lq\]e formalism's intended usage is 
to relate expressions of natural anguages to their associ- 
ated semantics represented in a logical tbrm language, or 
to their translates in another natural anguage; in sum- 
mary, we intend it to allow TAGs to be used beyond 
their role in syntax proper. We discuss the application 
of synchronous TAGs to concrete examples, mention- 
ing primarily in passing some computational issues that 
tu:ise in its interpretation.
