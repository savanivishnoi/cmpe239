T.S. Eliot?s modernist poem The Waste Land is
often interpreted as collection of voices which
appear multiple times throughout the text. Here,
we investigate whether we can automatically
cluster existing segmentations of the text into
coherent, expert-identified characters. We show
that clustering The Waste Land is a fairly dif-
ficult task, though we can do much better than
random baselines, particularly if we begin with
a good initial segmentation.
