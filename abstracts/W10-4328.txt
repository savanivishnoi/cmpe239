The current study examines people?s close-range route instructions for robots and how the presentation format (schematic, vir-tual or natural) and the complexity of the route affect the content of instructions. We find that people have a general preference for providing metric-based instructions. At the same time, presentation format appears to have less im-pact on the formulation of these instructions. We conclude that understanding of spatial lan-guage requires handling both landmark-based and metric-based expressions. 1
