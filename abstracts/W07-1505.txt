We introduce an annotation type system for
a data-driven NLP core system. The specifi-
cations cover formal document structure and
document meta information, as well as the
linguistic levels of morphology, syntax and
semantics. The type system is embedded in
the framework of the Unstructured Informa-
tion Management Architecture (UIMA).
