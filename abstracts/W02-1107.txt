 
We treat nouns that behave adjectively, which we 
call adjectival nouns, extracted from large corpora. 
For example, in ?financial world? and ?world of 
finance,? ?financial? and ?finance? are different 
parts of speech, but their semantic behaviors are 
similar to each other. We investigate how adjectival 
nouns are similar to adjectives and different from 
non-adjectival nouns by using self-organizing 
semantic maps. We create five kinds of semantic 
maps, i.e., semantic maps of abstract nouns 
organized via (1) adjectives, (2) adjectival nouns, 
(3) non-adjectival nouns and (4) adjectival and 
adjectival nouns and a semantic map of adjectives, 
adjectival nouns and non-adjectival nouns organized 
via collocated abstract nouns, and compare them 
with each other to find similarities and differences.
