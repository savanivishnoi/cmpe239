 
A chatbot is a software system, which can 
interact or ?chat? with a human user in 
natural language such as English. For the 
annual Loebner Prize contest, rival chat-
bots have been assessed in terms of ability 
to fool a judge in a restricted chat session. 
We are investigating methods to train and 
adapt a chatbot to a specific user?s lan-
guage use or application, via a user-
supplied training corpus. We advocate 
open-ended trials by real users, such as an 
example Afrikaans chatbot for Afrikaans-
speaking researchers and students in 
South Africa. This is evaluated in terms of 
?glass box? dialogue efficiency metrics, 
and ?black box? dialogue quality metrics 
and user satisfaction feedback. The other 
examples presented in this paper are the 
Qur'an and the FAQchat prototypes.  Our 
general conclusion is that evaluation 
should be adapted to the application and 
to user needs.
