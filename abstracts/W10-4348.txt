Transcription and semantic annotation
(annoscription) of utterances is crucial
part of speech performance analysis and
tuning of spoken dialog systems and other
natural language processing disciplines.
However, the fact that these are manual
tasks makes them expensive and slow. In
this paper, we will discuss how anno-
scription can be partially automated. We
will show that annoscription can reach a
throughput of 693 thousand utterances per
person month under certain assumptions.
