Implicit discourse relation recognition is
difficult due to the absence of explicit
discourse connectives between arbitrary
spans of text. In this paper, we use lan-
guage models to predict the discourse con-
nectives between the arguments pair. We
present two methods to apply the pre-
dicted connectives to implicit discourse
relation recognition. One is to use the
sense frequency of the specific connec-
tives in a supervised framework. The
other is to directly use the presence of the
predicted connectives in an unsupervised
way. Results on PDTB2 show that using
language model to predict the connectives
can achieve comparable F-scores to the
previous state-of-art method. Our method
is quite promising in that not only it has
a very small number of features but also
once a language model based on other re-
sources is trained it can be more adaptive
to other languages and domains.
