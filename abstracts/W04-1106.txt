 
This paper presents a character-based model of 
automatic sense determination for Chinese 
compounds. The model adopts a sense 
approximation approach using synonymous 
compounds retrieved by measuring similarity 
of semantic template in compounding. The 
similarity measure is derived from an 
association network among characters and 
senses, which is built from a formatted MRD. 
Adopting the taxonomy of CILIN, a system of 
deep semantic classification (at least to the 
small classes) for V-V compounds is 
implemented and evaluated to test the model. 
The experiment reports a high precision rate 
(about 38% in outside test and 61% in inside 
test) against the baseline one (about 18%).
