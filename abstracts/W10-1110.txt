In this pilot study we define and apply a methodol-
ogy for building an event extraction system for the
Swedish scientific medical and clinical language.
Our aim is to find and describe linguistic expres-
sions which refer to medical events, such as events
related to diseases, symptoms and drug effects. In
order to achieve this goal we have initiated actions
that aim to extend and refine parts of the ongoing
compilation of the Swedish FrameNet++ (SFN++).
SFN++, as its English original predecessor, is
grounded in Frame Semantics which provides a
sound theoretical ground for modeling and linking
linguistic structures encountered in general lan-
guage and in specific domains (after specializa-
tion). Using such resource we have started to
manually annotate domain texts for enriching
SFN++ with authentic samples and for providing
training data for automated event extraction tech-
niques.
