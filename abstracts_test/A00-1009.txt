 
In this paper we describe an implemented 
framework for developing monolingual or 
multilingual natural language generation 
(NLG) applications and machine translation 
(MT) applications. The framework 
demonstrates a uniform approach to 
generation and transfer based on declarative 
lexico-structural transformations of 
dependency structures of syntactic or 
conceptual levels ("uniform lexico-structural 
processing"). We describe how this 
framework has been used in practical NLG 
and MT applications, and report he lessons 
learned.
