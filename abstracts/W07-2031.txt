For the metonymy resolution task at
SemEval-2007, the use of a memory-based
learner to train classifiers for the identifica-
tion of metonymic location names is inves-
tigated. Metonymy is resolved on different
levels of granularity, differentiating between
literal and non-literal readings on the coarse
level; literal, metonymic, and mixed read-
ings on the medium level; and a number of
classes covering regular cases of metonymy
on a fine level. Different kinds of context
are employed to obtain different features:
1) a sequence of n1 synset IDs represent-
ing subordination information for nouns and
for verbs, 2) n2 prepositions, articles, modal,
and main verbs in the same sentence, and 3)
properties of n3 tokens in a context window
to the left and to the right of the location
name.
Different classifiers were trained on the
Mascara data set to determine which values
for the context sizes n1, n2, and n3 yield
the highest accuracy (n1 = 4, n2 = 3,
and n3 = 7, determined with the leave-one-
out method). Results from these classifiers
served as features for a combined classifier.
In the training phase, the combined classifier
achieved a considerably higher precision for
the Mascara data. In the SemEval submis-
sion, an accuracy of 79.8% on the coarse,
79.5% on the medium, and 78.5% on the
fine level is achieved (the baseline accuracy
is 79.4%).
