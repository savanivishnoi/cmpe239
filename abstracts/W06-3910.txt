Verbs or adjectives and their nominalizations and certain adverb adjective pairs
can be argued to introduce the same concept. This can be shown through inference
patterns, which can be explained if we assume Davidsonian eventualities underlying
all predicates. We make a contribution to the underlying state discussion by inves-
tigating the advantages and disadvantages of Davidsonian versus Kimian states for
statives such as copular predicates. Findings are implemented in our parser Delilah.
