 
Our goal is to make note-taking easier in 
meetings by automatically detecting 
noteworthy utterances in verbal ex-
changes and suggesting them to meeting 
participants for inclusion in their notes. 
To show feasibility of such a process we 
conducted a Wizard of Oz study where 
the Wizard picked automatically tran-
scribed utterances that he judged as 
noteworthy, and suggested their contents 
to the participants as notes. Over 9 meet-
ings, participants accepted 35% of these 
suggestions. Further, 41.5% of their notes 
at the end of the meeting contained Wi-
zard-suggested text. Next, in order to per-
form noteworthiness detection automati-
cally, we annotated a set of 6 meetings 
with a 3-level noteworthiness annotation 
scheme, which is a break from the binary 
?in summary?/ ?not in summary? labe-
ling typically used in speech summariza-
tion. We report Kappa of 0.44 for the 3-
way classification, and 0.58 when two of 
the 3 labels are merged into one. Finally, 
we trained an SVM classifier on this an-
notated data; this classifier?s performance 
lies between that of trivial baselines and 
inter-annotator agreement.
