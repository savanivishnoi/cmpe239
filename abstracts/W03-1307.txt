 
In this paper, we explore how to adapt a 
general Hidden Markov Model-based 
named entity recognizer effectively to 
biomedical domain.  We integrate various 
features, including simple deterministic 
features, morphological features, POS 
features and semantic trigger features, to 
capture various evidences especially for 
biomedical named entity and evaluate 
their contributions.  We also present a 
simple algorithm to solve the abbreviation 
problem and a rule-based method to deal 
with the cascaded phenomena in biomedi-
cal domain.  Our experiments on GENIA 
V3.0 and GENIA V1.1 achieve the 66.1 
and 62.5 F-measure respectively, which 
outperform the previous best published 
results by 8.1 F-measure when using the 
same training and testing data.
