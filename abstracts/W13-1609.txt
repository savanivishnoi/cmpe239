This article provides an in-depth research of
machine learning methods for sentiment ana-
lysis of Czech social media. Whereas in En-
glish, Chinese, or Spanish this field has a
long history and evaluation datasets for vari-
ous domains are widely available, in case of
Czech language there has not yet been any
systematical research conducted. We tackle
this issue and establish a common ground for
further research by providing a large human-
annotated Czech social media corpus. Fur-
thermore, we evaluate state-of-the-art super-
vised machine learning methods for sentiment
analysis. We explore different pre-processing
techniques and employ various features and
classifiers. Moreover, in addition to our newly
created social media dataset, we also report re-
sults on other widely popular domains, such
as movie and product reviews. We believe
that this article will not only extend the current
sentiment analysis research to another family
of languages, but will also encourage competi-
tion which potentially leads to the production
of high-end commercial solutions.
