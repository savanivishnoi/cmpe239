 
In this paper we address the following 
questions from our experience of the last two 
and a half years in developing a large-scale 
corpus of Arabic text annotated for 
morphological information, part-of-speech, 
English gloss, and syntactic structure:  (a) 
How did we ?leapfrog? through the stumbling 
blocks of both methodology and training in 
setting up the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) 
annotation? (b) How did we reconcile the 
Penn Treebank annotation principles and 
practices with the Modern Standard Arabic 
(MSA) traditional and more recent 
grammatical concepts? (c) What are the 
current issues and nagging problems? (d) 
What has been achieved and what are our 
future expectations?
