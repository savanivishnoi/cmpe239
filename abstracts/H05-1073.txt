In addition to information, text con-
tains attitudinal, and more specifically,
emotional content. This paper explores
the text-based emotion prediction prob-
lem empirically, using supervised machine
learning with the SNoW learning archi-
tecture. The goal is to classify the emo-
tional affinity of sentences in the narra-
tive domain of children?s fairy tales, for
subsequent usage in appropriate expres-
sive rendering of text-to-speech synthe-
sis. Initial experiments on a preliminary
data set of 22 fairy tales show encourag-
ing results over a na??ve baseline and BOW
approach for classification of emotional
versus non-emotional contents, with some
dependency on parameter tuning. We
also discuss results for a tripartite model
which covers emotional valence, as well
as feature set alernations. In addition, we
present plans for a more cognitively sound
sequential model, taking into considera-
tion a larger set of basic emotions.
