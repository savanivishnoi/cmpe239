 
  We present an automatic semantic roles labeling 
system for structured trees of Chinese sentences. It 
adopts dependency decision making and 
example-based approaches. The training data and 
extracted examples are from the Sinica Treebank, 
which is a Chinese Treebank with semantic role 
assigned for each constituent. It used 74 abstract 
semantic roles including thematic roles, such as 
?agent?; ?theme?, ?instrument?, and secondary roles of 
?location?, ?time?, ?manner? and roles for nominal 
modifiers. The design of role assignment algorithm is 
based on the different decision features, such as 
head-argument/modifier, case makers, sentence 
structures etc. It labels semantic roles of parsed 
sentences. Therefore the practical performance of the 
system depends on a good parser which labels the 
right structures of sentences. The system achieves 
92.71% accuracy in labeling the semantic roles for 
pre-structure- bracketed texts which is considerably 
higher than the simple method using probabilistic 
model of head-modifier relations.
