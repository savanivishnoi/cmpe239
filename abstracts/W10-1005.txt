We investigate the use of web search queries 
for detecting errors in non-native writing. Dis-
tinguishing a correct sequence of words from 
a sequence with a learner error is a baseline 
task that any error detection and correction 
system needs to address. Using a large corpus 
of error-annotated learner data, we investigate 
whether web search result counts can be used 
to distinguish correct from incorrect usage. In 
this investigation, we compare a variety of 
query formulation strategies and a number of 
web resources, including two major search 
engine APIs and a large web-based n-gram 
corpus.
