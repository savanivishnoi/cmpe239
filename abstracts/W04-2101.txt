  
Kanji dictionaries, which need to present a 
large number of complex characters in an 
order that makes them accessible by users, 
traditionally use several indexing techniques 
that are particularly suited to the printed 
medium. Electronic dictionary technology 
provides the opportunity of both introducing 
new indexing techniques that are not 
feasible with printed dictionaries, and also 
allowing a wide range of index methods 
with each dictionary. It also allows 
dictionaries to be interfaced at the character 
level with documents and applications, thus 
removing much of the requirement for 
complex index methods. This paper surveys 
the traditional indexing methods, introduces 
some of the new indexing techniques that 
have become available with electronic kanji 
dictionaries, and reports on an analysis of 
the index usage patterns in a major WWW-
based electronic kanji dictionary. This is 
believed to be the first such analysis 
conducted and reported.
