Automatic relation extraction provides great
support for scientists and database curators in
dealing with the extensive amount of biomed-
ical textual data. The DDIExtraction 2013
challenge poses the task of detecting drug-
drug interactions and further categorizing
them into one of the four relation classes. We
present our machine learning system which
utilizes lexical, syntactical and semantic based
feature sets. Resampling, balancing and en-
semble learning experiments are performed to
infer the best configuration. For general drug-
drug relation extraction, the system achieves
70.4% in F1 score.
