Native Language Identification, or NLI, is the
task of automatically classifying the L1 of a
writer based solely on his or her essay writ-
ten in another language. This problem area
has seen a spike in interest in recent years
as it can have an impact on educational ap-
plications tailored towards non-native speak-
ers of a language, as well as authorship pro-
filing. While there has been a growing body
of work in NLI, it has been difficult to com-
pare methodologies because of the different
approaches to pre-processing the data, differ-
ent sets of languages identified, and different
splits of the data used. In this shared task, the
first ever for Native Language Identification,
we sought to address the above issues by pro-
viding a large corpus designed specifically for
NLI, in addition to providing an environment
for systems to be directly compared. In this
paper, we report the results of the shared task.
A total of 29 teams from around the world
competed across three different sub-tasks.
