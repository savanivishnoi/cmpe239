 
Our general research aim is to extract the 
actual intentions of persons when they 
respond to open-ended questionnaires. 
These intentions include the desire to 
make requests, complaints, expressions of 
resignation and so forth, but here we 
focus on extracting the intention to make 
a request. To do so, we first have to judge 
whether their responses contain the intent 
to make a request. Therefore, as a first 
step, we have developed a criterion for 
judging the existence of request intentions 
in responses. This criterion, which is 
based on paraphrasing, is described in 
detail in this paper. Our assumption is that 
a response with request intentions can be 
paraphrased into a typical request 
expression, e.g., ?I would like to ...?, 
while responses without request are not 
paraphrasable. The criterion is evaluated 
in terms of objectivity, reproducibility and 
effectiveness. Objectivity is demonstrated 
by showing that machine learning 
methods can learn the criterion from a set 
of intention-tagged data, while 
reproducibility, that the judgments of 
three annotators are reasonably consistent, 
and effectiveness, that judgments based 
not on the criterion but on intuition do not 
agree. This means the criterion is 
necessary to achieve reproducibility. 
These experiments indicate that the 
criterion can be used to judge the 
existence of request intentions in 
responses reliably.
