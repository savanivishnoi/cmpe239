 
We introduce a multi-language 
named-entity recognition system based on 
HMM. Japanese, Chinese, Korean and 
English versions have already been 
implemented. In principle, it can analyze 
any other language if we have training 
data of the target language. This system 
has a common analytical engine and it can 
handle any language simply by changing 
the lexical analysis rules and statistical 
language model. In this paper, we 
describe the architecture and accuracy of 
the named-entity system, and report 
preliminary experiments on automatic 
bilingual named-entity dictionary 
construction using the Japanese and 
English named-entity recognizer.
