To avoid a sarcastic message being understood
in its unintended literal meaning, in microtexts
such as messages on Twitter.com sarcasm is
often explicitly marked with the hashtag ?#sar-
casm?. We collected a training corpus of about
78 thousand Dutch tweets with this hashtag.
Assuming that the human labeling is correct
(annotation of a sample indicates that about
85% of these tweets are indeed sarcastic), we
train a machine learning classifier on the har-
vested examples, and apply it to a test set of
a day?s stream of 3.3 million Dutch tweets.
Of the 135 explicitly marked tweets on this
day, we detect 101 (75%) when we remove the
hashtag. We annotate the top of the ranked list
of tweets most likely to be sarcastic that do not
have the explicit hashtag. 30% of the top-250
ranked tweets are indeed sarcastic. Analysis
shows that sarcasm is often signalled by hy-
perbole, using intensifiers and exclamations;
in contrast, non-hyperbolic sarcastic messages
often receive an explicit marker. We hypothe-
size that explicit markers such as hashtags are
the digital extralinguistic equivalent of non-
verbal expressions that people employ in live
interaction when conveying sarcasm.
