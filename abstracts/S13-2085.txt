For SemEval-2013 Task 2, A and B (Sen-
timent Analysis in Twitter), we use a rule-
based pattern matching system that is based on
an existing ?Domain Independent? sentiment
taxonomy for English, essentially a highly
phrasal sentiment lexicon. We have made
some modifications to our set of rules, based
on what we found in the annotated training
data that was made available for the task. The
resulting system scores competitively, espe-
cially on task B.
