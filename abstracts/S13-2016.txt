 
This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI-(EPS) system, which 
participated in the first Evaluating Phrasal 
Semantics of SemEval-2013. Our supervised 
system uses different kinds of semantic 
features to train a bagging classifier used to 
select the correct similarity option. Related to 
the different features we can highlight the 
resource WordNet used to extract semantic 
relations among words and the use of different 
algorithms to establish semantic similarities. 
Our system obtains promising results with a 
precision value around 78% for the English 
corpus and 71.84% for the Italian corpus.
