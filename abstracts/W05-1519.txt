 
This paper describes our effort on the task 
of edited region identification for parsing 
disfluent sentences in the Switchboard 
corpus. We focus our attention on 
exploring feature spaces and selecting 
good features and start with analyzing the 
distributions of the edited regions and 
their components in the targeted corpus. 
We explore new feature spaces of a part-
of-speech (POS) hierarchy and relaxed for 
rough copy in the experiments. These 
steps result in an improvement of 43.98% 
percent relative error reduction in F-score 
over an earlier best result in edited 
detection when punctuation is included in 
both training and testing data [Charniak 
and Johnson 2001], and 20.44% percent 
relative error reduction in F-score over the 
latest best result where punctuation is 
excluded from the training and testing 
data [Johnson and Charniak 2004].
