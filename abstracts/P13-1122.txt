This paper presents HEADY: a novel, ab-
stractive approach for headline generation
from news collections. From a web-scale
corpus of English news, we mine syntac-
tic patterns that a Noisy-OR model gener-
alizes into event descriptions. At inference
time, we query the model with the patterns
observed in an unseen news collection,
identify the event that better captures the
gist of the collection and retrieve the most
appropriate pattern to generate a head-
line. HEADY improves over a state-of-the-
art open-domain title abstraction method,
bridging half of the gap that separates
it from extractive methods using human-
generated titles in manual evaluations, and
performs comparably to human-generated
headlines as evaluated with ROUGE.
