 
It is argued in this paper that an optimal 
solution to disambiguation is a combination of 
linguistically motivated rules and resolution 
based on probability or heuristic rules. By 
disambiguation is here meant ambiguity 
resolution on all levels of language analysis, 
including morphology and semantics. The 
discussion is based on Swahili, for which a 
comprehensive analysis system has been 
developed by using two-level description in 
morphology and constraint grammar 
formalism in disambiguation. Particular 
attention is paid to optimising the use of 
different solutions for achieving maximal 
precision with minimal rule writing.
