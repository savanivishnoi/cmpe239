. Automatic image annotation is a newly developed and promising 
technique to provide semantic image retrieval via text descriptions. It concerns 
a process of automatically labeling the image contents with a pre-defined set of 
keywords which are exploited to represent the image semantics. A Maximum 
Entropy Model-based approach to the task of automatic image annotation is 
proposed in this paper. In the phase of training, a basic visual vocabulary con-
sisting of blob-tokens to describe the image content is generated at first; then 
the statistical relationship is modeled between the blob-tokens and keywords by 
a Maximum Entropy Model constructed from the training set of labeled images. 
In the phase of annotation, for an unlabeled image, the most likely associated 
keywords are predicted in terms of the blob-token set extracted from the given 
image. We carried out experiments on a medium-sized image collection with 
about 5000 images from Corel Photo CDs. The experimental results demon-
strated that the annotation performance of this method outperforms some tradi-
tional annotation methods by about 8% in mean precision, showing a potential 
of the Maximum Entropy Model in the task of automatic image annotation.
