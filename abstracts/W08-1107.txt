In this paper, we propose to reinterpret the
problem of generating referring expressions
(GRE) as the problem of computing a formula
in a description logic that is only satisfied by
the referent. This view offers a new unifying
perspective under which existing GRE algo-
rithms can be compared. We also show that
by applying existing algorithms for computing
simulation classes in description logic, we can
obtain extremely efficient algorithms for rela-
tional referring expressions without any dan-
ger of running into infinite regress.
