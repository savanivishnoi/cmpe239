We introduce bilingual word embeddings: se-
mantic embeddings associated across two lan-
guages in the context of neural language mod-
els. We propose a method to learn bilingual
embeddings from a large unlabeled corpus,
while utilizing MT word alignments to con-
strain translational equivalence. The new em-
beddings significantly out-perform baselines
in word semantic similarity. A single semantic
similarity feature induced with bilingual em-
beddings adds near half a BLEU point to the
results of NIST08 Chinese-English machine
translation task.
