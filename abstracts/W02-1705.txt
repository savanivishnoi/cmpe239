The PAPILLON project aims at creating a cooperative, free, permanent, web-oriented and personalizable environment for the
development and the consultation of a multilingual lexical database. The initial motivation is the lack of dictionaries, both for
humans and machines, between French and many Asian languages. In particular, although there are large F-J paper usage
dictionaries, they are usable only by Japanese literates, as they never contain both original (kanji/kana) and romaji writing.
This applies as well to Thai, Vietnamese, Lao, etc.
