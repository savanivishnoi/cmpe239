 
We propose a method for dealing with 
semantic complexities occurring in 
information retrieval systems on the basis of 
linguistic observations. Our method follows 
from an analysis indicating that long runs of 
content words appear in a stopped ocument 
cluster, and our observation that these long 
runs predominately originate from the 
prepositional phrase and subject 
complement positions and as such, may be 
useful predictors of semantic coherence. 
From this linguistic basis, we test three 
statistical hypotheses over a small collection 
of documents from different genre. By 
coordinating thesaurus emantic ategories 
(SEMCATs) of the long run words to the 
semantic categories of paragraphs, we 
conclude that for paragraphs containing both 
long runs and short runs, the SEMCAT 
weight of long runs of content words is a 
strong predictor of the semantic oherence 
of the paragraph.
