We present SPred, a novel method for the
creation of large repositories of semantic
predicates. We start from existing colloca-
tions to form lexical predicates (e.g., break
?) and learn the semantic classes that best
fit the ? argument. To do this, we extract
all the occurrences in Wikipedia which
match the predicate and abstract its argu-
ments to general semantic classes (e.g.,
break BODY PART, break AGREEMENT,
etc.). Our experiments show that we are
able to create a large collection of seman-
tic predicates from the Oxford Advanced
Learner?s Dictionary with high precision
and recall, and perform well against the
most similar approach.
