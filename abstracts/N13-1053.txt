The rising influence of user-generated online
reviews (Cone, 2011) has led to growing in-
centive for businesses to solicit and manufac-
ture DECEPTIVE OPINION SPAM?fictitious
reviews that have been deliberately written to
sound authentic and deceive the reader. Re-
cently, Ott et al (2011) have introduced an
opinion spam dataset containing gold standard
deceptive positive hotel reviews. However, the
complementary problem of negative deceptive
opinion spam, intended to slander competitive
offerings, remains largely unstudied. Follow-
ing an approach similar to Ott et al (2011), in
this work we create and study the first dataset
of deceptive opinion spam with negative sen-
timent reviews. Based on this dataset, we find
that standard n-gram text categorization tech-
niques can detect negative deceptive opinion
spam with performance far surpassing that of
human judges. Finally, in conjunction with
the aforementioned positive review dataset,
we consider the possible interactions between
sentiment and deception, and present initial
results that encourage further exploration of
this relationship.
