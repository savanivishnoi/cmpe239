This paper describes our system for participat-
ing SemEval2013 Task2-B (Kozareva et al,
2013): Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Given
a message, our system classifies whether the
message is positive, negative or neutral senti-
ment. It uses a co-occurrence rate model. The
training data are constrained to the data pro-
vided by the task organizers (No other tweet
data are used). We consider 9 types of fea-
tures and use a subset of them in our submitted
system. To see the contribution of each type of
features, we do experimental study on features
by leaving one type of features out each time.
Results suggest that unigrams are the most im-
portant features, bigrams and POS tags seem
not helpful, and stopwords should be retained
to achieve the best results. The overall results
of our system are promising regarding the con-
strained features and data we use.
