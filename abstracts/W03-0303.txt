In this paper, an improved word alignment
based on bilingual bracketing is described. The
explored approaches include using Model-1
conditional probability, a boosting strategy for
lexicon probabilities based on importance sam-
pling, applying Parts of Speech to discriminate
English words and incorporating information
of English base noun phrase. The results of
the shared task on French-English, Romanian-
English and Chinese-English word alignments
are presented and discussed.
