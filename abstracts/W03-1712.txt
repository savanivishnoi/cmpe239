 
At present most of corpora are annotated 
mainly with syntactic knowledge. In this 
paper, we attempt to build a large corpus 
and annotate semantic knowledge with 
dependency grammar. We believe that 
words are the basic units of semantics, 
and the structure and meaning of a 
sentence consist mainly of a series of 
semantic dependencies between 
individual words. A 1,000,000-word-
scale corpus annotated with semantic 
dependency has been built. Compared 
with syntactic knowledge, semantic 
knowledge is more difficult to annotate, 
for ambiguity problem is more serious. In 
the paper, the strategy to improve 
consistency is addressed, and congruence 
is defined to measure the consistency of 
tagged corpus.. Finally, we will compare 
our corpus with other well-known 
corpora.
