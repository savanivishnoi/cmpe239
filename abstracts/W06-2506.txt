This paper presents an analysis of seman-
tic association norms for German nouns.
In contrast to prior studies, we not only
collected associations elicited by written
representations of target objects but also
by their pictorial representations. In a first
analysis, we identified systematic differ-
ences in the type and distribution of as-
sociate responses for the two presentation
forms. In a second analysis, we applied a
soft cluster analysis to the collected target-
response pairs. We subsequently used the
clustering to predict noun ambiguity and
to discriminate senses in our target nouns.
