This paper describes the development of a
statistical machine translation system based
on the Moses decoder for the 2007 WMT
shared tasks. Several different translation
strategies were explored. We also use a sta-
tistical language model that is based on a
continuous representation of the words in
the vocabulary. By these means we expect to
take better advantage of the limited amount
of training data. Finally, we have investi-
gated the usefulness of a second reference
translation of the development data.
