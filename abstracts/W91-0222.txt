  
This paper proposes a two-level model that integrates tense and aspect information, 
based on theories by both Hornstein (in the spirit of Reichenbach) and Allen, with 
lexicai-semantic nformation based on an extended version of $ackendoff's theory 
that includes a verb classification system proposed by Dowty and Vendler. The 
model is intended to be extensible to realms outside of the temporal domain (e.g., 
the spatial domain). The integration of tense and aspect with lexical-semantics 
is especially critical in machine translation because of the lexical selection process 
during generation: there is often a number of lexical connective and tense/aspect 
possibilities that may be produced from a lexical semantic representation, which, 
as defined in the model presented here, is largely underspecified. The use of tense 
and aspect information allows the choice of target-language t rms to be more finely 
tuned and the combination of event structures to be more carefully constrained.
