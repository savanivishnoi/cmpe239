In functional and logic programming,
parsers can be built as modular executable
specifications of grammars, using parser
combinators and definite clause grammars
respectively. These techniques are based on
top-down backtracking search. Commonly
used implementations are inefficient for
ambiguous languages, cannot accommodate
left-recursive grammars, and require expo-
nential space to represent parse trees for
highly ambiguous input. Memoization is
known to improve efficiency, and work by
other researchers has had some success in
accommodating left recursion. This paper
combines aspects of previous approaches
and presents a method by which parsers can
be built as modular and efficient executable
specifications of ambiguous grammars
containing unconstrained left recursion.
