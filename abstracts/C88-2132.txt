 
Chart parsing is directional in the sense that it works 
from the starting point (usually the beginning of the 
sentence) extending its activity usually in a rightward 
manner. We shall introduce the concept of a chart that 
works outward from islands and makes sense of as much 
of the sentence as it is actually possible, and after that will 
lead to predictions of missing fragments. So, for any place 
where the easily identifiable fragments occur in the 
sentence, the process will extend to both the left and the 
right of the islands, until possibly completely missing 
fragments are reached. At that point, by virtue of the fact 
that both a left and a right context were found, heuristics 
can be introduced that predict he nature of the missing 
fragments.
