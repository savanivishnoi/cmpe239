In this paper, we propose a memory, space,
and time efficient framework to scale dis-
tributional similarity to the web. We
exploit sketch techniques, especially the
Count-Min sketch, which approximates
the frequency of an item in the corpus
without explicitly storing the item itself.
These methods use hashing to deal with
massive amounts of the streaming text. We
store all item counts computed from 90
GB of web data in just 2 billion coun-
ters (8 GB main memory) of CM sketch.
Our method returns semantic similarity
between word pairs in O(K) time and
can compute similarity between any word
pairs that are stored in the sketch. In our
experiments, we show that our framework
is as effective as using the exact counts.
