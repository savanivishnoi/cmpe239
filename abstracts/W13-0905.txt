 The paper presents an experimental algorithm to detect conventionalized metaphors implicit in the lexical data in a resource like WordNet, where metaphors are coded into the senses and so would never be detected by any algorithm based on the violation of preferences, since there would always be a constraint satisfied by such senses. We report an implementation of this algorithm, which was implemented first the preference constraints in VerbNet. We then derived in a systematic way a far more extensive set of constraints based on WordNet glosses, and with this data we reimplemented the detec-tion algorithm and got a substantial improvement in recall. We suggest that this technique could contribute to improve the performance of existing metaphor detec-tion strategies that do not attempt to detect convention-alized metaphors. The new WordNet-derived data is of wider significance because it also contains adjective constraints, unlike any existing lexical resource, and can be applied to any language with a semantic parser (and WN) for it. 1
