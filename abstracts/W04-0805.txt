The Italian lexical sample task at
SENSEVAL-3 provided a framework to
evaluate supervised and semi-supervised
WSD systems. This paper reports on the
task preparation ? which offered the op-
portunity to review and refine the Italian
MultiWordNet ? and on the results of the
six participants, focussing on both the
manual and automatic tagging procedures.
