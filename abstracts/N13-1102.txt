In this paper, we propose a multi-step stacked
learning model for disfluency detection. Our
method incorporates refined n-gram features
step by step from different word sequences.
First, we detect filler words. Second, edited
words are detected using n-gram features ex-
tracted from both the original text and filler fil-
tered text. In the third step, additional n-gram
features are extracted from edit removed texts
together with our newly induced in-between
features to improve edited word detection. We
useMax-MarginMarkov Networks (M3Ns) as
the classifier with the weighted hamming loss
to balance precision and recall. Experiments
on the Switchboard corpus show that the re-
fined n-gram features from multiple steps and
M3Ns with weighted hamming loss can signif-
icantly improve the performance. Our method
for disfluency detection achieves the best re-
ported F-score 0.841 without the use of addi-
tional resources.1
