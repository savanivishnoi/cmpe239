 
In this paper, a method is presented to 
recognize multilingual Wikipedia named entity 
articles. This method classifies multilingual 
Wikipedia articles using a variety of structured 
and unstructured features and is aided by 
cross-language links and features in 
Wikipedia.  Adding multilingual features helps 
boost classification accuracy and is shown to 
effectively classify multilingual pages in a 
language independent way.  Classification is 
done using Support Vectors Machine (SVM) 
classifier at first, and then the threshold of 
SVM is adjusted in order to improve the recall 
scores of classification. Threshold adjustment 
is performed using beta-gamma threshold 
adjustment algorithm which is a post learning 
step that shifts the hyperplane of SVM. This 
approach boosted recall with minimal effect on 
precision.
