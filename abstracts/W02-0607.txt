We describe here a supervised learning
model that, given paradigms of related
words, learns the morphological and
phonological rules needed to derive the
paradigm. The model can use its rules to
make guesses about how novel forms
would be inflected, and has been tested
experimentally against the intuitions of
human speakers.
