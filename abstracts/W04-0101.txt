The evolution of competing lexical categories
is simulated within a model in which lexical
outputs are organized as sequences of
articulatory gestures. When exemplar-based
categories compete for assignment and storage
of incoming exemplars in a production/storage
loop,  contrast  between categories
spontaneously emerges and remains stable,
driven by the differences in storage
consistency between more contrastive and less
contrastive variants. Further, when lexical
outputs are biased toward use of previously
produced gestures, the set of exemplars in the
lexicon evolve to be derived from a small set
of contrastive units used in combination,
despite the absence of direct selection for
contrast at the sub-lexical level.
