 
In this paper, we propose a topic detection 
method using a dialogue history for 
selecting a scene in the automatic 
interpretation system (Ikeda et al, 2002).  
The method uses a k-nearest neighbor 
method for the algorithm, automatically 
clusters target topics into smaller topics 
grouped by similarity, and incorporates 
dialogue history weighted in terms of time 
to detect and track topics on spoken 
phrases.  From the evaluation of 
detection performance using test corpus 
comprised of realistic spoken dialogue, 
the method has shown to perform better 
with clustering incorporated, and 
combined with time-weighted dialogue 
history of three sentences, gives detection 
accuracy of 77.0%.
