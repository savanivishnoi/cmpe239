 
We present an operable definition of focus 
which is argued to be of a cognito-pragmatic 
nature and explore how it is determined in 
discourse in a formalized manner. For this 
purpose, a file card model of discourse model 
and knowledge store is introduced enabling the 
decomposition a d formal representation f its 
determination process as a programmable 
algorithm (FDA). Interdisciplinary evidence 
from social and cognitive psychology is cited 
and the prospect of the integration of focus via 
FDA as a discourse-level construct into speech 
synthesis systems, in particular, concept-to- 
speech systems, is also briefly discussed.
