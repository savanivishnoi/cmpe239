 The paper presents a rapid method of 
developing a shallow Arabic 
morphological analyzer.  The analyzer 
will only be concerned with generating 
the possible roots of any given Arabic 
word.  The analyzer is based on 
automatically derived rules and statistics.  
For evaluation, the analyzer is compared 
to a commercially available Arabic 
Morphological Analyzer.
