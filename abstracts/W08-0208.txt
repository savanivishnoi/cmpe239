The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is
widely used for teaching natural language
processing to students majoring in linguistics
or computer science. This paper describes
the design of NLTK, and reports on how
it has been used effectively in classes that
involve different mixes of linguistics and
computer science students. We focus on three
key issues: getting started with a course,
delivering interactive demonstrations in the
classroom, and organizing assignments and
projects. In each case, we report on practical
experience and make recommendations on
how to use NLTK to maximum effect.
