 
We present a tool, called ILIMP, which 
takes as input a raw text in French and 
produces as output the same text in 
which every occurrence of the pronoun 
il is tagged either with tag [ANA] for 
anaphoric or [IMP] for impersonal or 
expletive. This tool is therefore 
designed to distinguish between the 
anaphoric occurrences of il, for which 
an anaphora resolution system has to 
look for an antecedent, and the expletive 
occurrences of this pronoun, for which it 
does not make sense to look for an 
antecedent. The precision rate for ILIMP 
is 97,5%. The few errors are analyzed in 
detail. Other tasks using the method 
developed for ILIMP are described 
briefly, as well as the use of ILIMP in a 
modular syntactic analysis system.
