The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task
examines semantic similarity at a sentence-
level. We explored three representations of
semantics (implicit or explicit): named enti-
ties, semantic vectors, and structured vectorial
semantics. From a DKPro baseline, we also
performed feature selection and used source-
specific linear regression models to combine
our features. Our systems placed 5th, 6th, and
8th among 90 submitted systems.
