 
This paper describes a novel undertaking: 
comparing the relationship between 
grammatical ambiguity (syncretism) in nouns, 
as represented in a default inheritance 
hierarchy, with textual frequency distributions. 
In order to do this we consider a language with 
a reasonable number of grammatical 
distinctions and where syncretism occurs in 
different morphological classes. We  
investigated this relationship for Russian 
nouns. Our results suggest that there is an 
intricate relationship between textual 
frequency and inflectional syncretism.
