 
We describe a system, UNN-WePS for 
identifying individuals from web pages us-
ing data from Semeval Task 13. Our sys-
tem is based on using co-presence of per-
son names to form seed clusters. These are 
then extended with pages that are deemed 
conceptually similar based on a lexical 
chaining analysis computed using Roget?s 
thesaurus. Finally, a single link hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering algorithm merges 
the enhanced clusters for individual entity 
recognition. UNN-WePS achieved an aver-
age purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73.
