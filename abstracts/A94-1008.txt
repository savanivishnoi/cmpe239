 
We discuss combining knowledge-based (or 
rule-based) and statistical part-of-speech 
taggers. We use two mature taggers, 
ENGCG and Xerox Tagger, to indepen- 
dently tag the same text and combine the 
results to produce a fully disambiguated 
text. In a 27000 word test sample taken 
from a previously unseen corpus we achieve 
98.5 % accuracy. This paper presents the 
data in detail. We describe the problems 
we encountered in the course of combining 
the two taggers and discuss the problem of 
evaluating taggers.
