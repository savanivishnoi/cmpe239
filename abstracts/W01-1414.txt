In the development of a machine
translation system, one important issue
is being able to adapt to a specific
domain without requiring time-
consuming lexical work. We have
experimented with using a statistical
word-alignment algorithm to derive
word association pairs (French-English)
that complement an existing multi-
purpose bilingual dictionary. This word
association information is added to the
system at the time of the automatic
creation of our translation pattern
database, thereby making this database
more domain specific. This technique
significantly improves the overall
quality of translation, as measured in an
independent blind evaluation.
