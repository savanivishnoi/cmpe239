We applied Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs) to the tasks of Amharic word seg-
mentation and POS tagging using a small
annotated corpus of 1000 words. Given
the size of the data and the large number of
unknown words in the test corpus (80%),
an accuracy of 84% for Amharic word
segmentation and 74% for POS tagging
is encouraging, indicating the applicabil-
ity of CRFs for a morphologically com-
plex language like Amharic.
