 
IF (Interchange Format), the interlingua used by 
the C-STAR consortium, is a speech-act based in- 
terlingua for task-oriented ialogue. IF was de- 
signed as a practical interlingua that could strike 
a balance between expressivity and simplicity. If 
it is too simple, components of meaning will be 
lost and coverage of unseen data will be low. On 
the other hand, if it is too complex, it cannot be 
used with a high degree of consistency by collab- 
orators on different continents. In this paper, we 
suggest methods for evaluating the coverage of IF 
and the consistency with which it was used in the 
C-STAR consortium.
