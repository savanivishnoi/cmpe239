We report on the performance of two different
feature sets in the Native Language Identification
Shared Task (Tetreault et al, 2013). Our feature
sets were inspired by existing literature on native
language identification and word networks. Exper-
iments show that word networks have competitive
performance against the baseline feature set, which
is a promising result. We also present a discussion
of feature analysis based on information gain, and an
overview on the performance of different word net-
work features in the Native Language Identification
task.
