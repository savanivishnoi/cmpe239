We describe work done at three sites on
designing conversational agents capable of
incremental processing. We focus on the
?middleware? layer in these systems, which
takes care of passing around and maintain-
ing incremental information between the
modules of such agents. All implementa-
tions are based on the abstract model of
incremental dialogue processing proposed
by Schlangen and Skantze (2009), and the
paper shows what different instantiations
of the model can look like given specific
requirements and application areas.
