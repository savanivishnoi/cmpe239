 
A novel method is presented for compiling 
two-level rules which have multiple context 
parts. The same method can also be applied 
to the resolution of so-called right-arrow rule 
conflicts. The method makes use of the fact 
that one can efficiently compose sets of two-
level rules with a lexicon transducer. By in-
troducing variant characters and using simple 
pre-processing of multi-context rules, all 
rules can be reduced into single-context rules. 
After the modified rules have been combined 
with the lexicon transducer, the variant char-
acters may be reverted back to the original 
surface characters. The proposed method ap-
pears to be efficient but only partial evidence 
is presented yet.
