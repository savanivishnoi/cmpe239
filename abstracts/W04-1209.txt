 
In the biological domain, extracting newly 
discovered functional features from the 
massive literature is a major challenging issue.  
To automatically annotate Gene References 
into Function (GeneRIF) in a new literature is 
the main goal of this paper.  We tried to find 
GRIF words in a training corpus, and then 
applied these informative words to annotate the 
GeneRIFs in abstracts with several different 
weighting schemes.  The experiments showed 
that the Classic Dice score is at most 50.18%, 
when the weighting schemes proposed in the 
paper (Hou et al, 2003) were adopted.  In 
contrast, after employing Support Vector 
Machines (SVMs) and the definition of classes 
proposed by Jelier et al (2003), the score 
greatly improved to 56.86% for Classic Dice 
(CD).  Adopting the same features, SVMs 
demonstrated advantage over the Na?ve Bayes 
Classifier.  Finally, the combination of the 
former two models attained a score of 59.51% 
for CD.
