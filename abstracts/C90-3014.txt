 
This paper describes the framework of a Korean 
phonological knowledge base system using the unification- 
based grammar formalism : Korean Phonology Structure 
Grammar (KPSG). The approach of KPSG provides an 
explicit development model for constructing a computational 
phonological system : speech recognition and synthesis ystem. 
We show that the proposed approach is more describable 
than other approaches uch as those employing a traditional 
generative phonological approach.
