This paper describes an on-going research for a
practical question answering system for a home
agent robot. Because the main concern of the QA
system for the home robot is the precision, rather
than coverage (No answer is better than wrong an-
swers), our approach is try to achieve high accuracy
in QA. We restrict the question domains and extract
answers from the pre-selected, semi-structured doc-
uments on the Internet. A named entity tagger and a
dependency parser are used to analyze the question
accurately. User profiling and inference rules are
used to infer hidden information that is required for
finding a precise answer. Testing with a small set of
queries on weather domain, the QA system showed
90.9% of precision and 75.0% of recall.
