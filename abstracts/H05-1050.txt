?Bootstrapping? methods for learning require a small amount
of supervision to seed the learning process. We show that it
is sometimes possible to eliminate this last bit of supervision,
by trying many candidate seeds and selecting the one with the
most plausible outcome. We discuss such ?strapping? methods
in general, and exhibit a particular method for strapping word-
sense classifiers for ambiguous words. Our experiments on the
Canadian Hansards show that our unsupervised technique is sig-
nificantly more effective than picking seeds by hand (Yarowsky,
1995), which in turn is known to rival supervised methods.
