 
Opinion mining is a growing research 
area both at the natural language proc-
essing and the information retrieval 
communities.  Companies, politicians, 
as well as customers need powerful 
tools to track opinions, sentiments, 
judgments and beliefs that people may 
express in blogs, reviews, audios and 
videos data regarding a prod-
uct/service/person/organisation/etc. This 
work describes our contribution to fea-
ture based opinion mining where opin-
ions expressed towards each feature of 
an object or a product are extracted and 
summarized. The state of the art has 
shown that the hierarchical organization 
of features is a key step. In this context, 
our goal is to study the role of a domain 
ontology to structure and extract object 
features as well as to produce a compre-
hensive summary. This paper presents 
the developed system and the experi-
ments we carried out on a case study: 
French restaurant reviews. Our results 
show that our approach outperforms 
standard baselines.
