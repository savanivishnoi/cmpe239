 
The statistical machine translation (SMT) sys-
tem heavily depends on the sentence aligned 
parallel corpus and the target language model. 
This paper points out some of the core issues 
on switching a language script and its reper-
cussion in the phrase based statistical machine 
translation system development. The present 
task reports on the outcome of English-
Manipuri language pair phrase based SMT 
task on two aspects ? a) Manipuri using Ben-
gali script, b) Manipuri using transliterated 
Meetei Mayek script. Two independent views 
on Bengali script based SMT and transliter-
ated Meitei Mayek based SMT systems of the 
training data and language models are pre-
sented and compared. The impact of various 
language models is commendable in such sce-
nario. The BLEU and NIST score shows that 
Bengali script based phrase based SMT 
(PBSMT) outperforms over the Meetei Mayek 
based English to Manipuri SMT system. 
However, subjective evaluation shows slight 
variation against the automatic scores.
