 
Based on a lexicon of Portuguese MWE, this 
presentation focuses on an ongoing work that 
aims at the creation of a typology that de-
scribes these expressions taking into account 
their semantic, syntactic and pragmatic prop-
erties. We also plan to annotate each MWE-
entry in the mentioned lexicon according to 
the information obtained from that typology. 
Our objective is to create a valuable resource, 
which will allow for the automatic identifica-
tion MWE in running text and for a deeper 
understanding of these expressions in their 
context.
