In this paper we apply conditional
random fields (CRFs) to the semantic
role labelling task. We define a random
field over the structure of each sentence?s
syntactic parse tree. For each node
of the tree, the model must predict a
semantic role label, which is interpreted
as the labelling for the corresponding
syntactic constituent. We show how
modelling the task as a tree labelling
problem allows for the use of efficient
CRF inference algorithms, while also
increasing generalisation performance
when compared to the equivalent
maximum entropy classifier. We have
participated in the CoNLL-2005 shared
task closed challenge with full syntactic
information.
