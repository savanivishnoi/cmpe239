This paper presents a headline emotion clas-
sification approach based on frequency and
co-occurrence information collected from
the World Wide Web. The content words of
a headline (nouns, verbs, adverbs and adjec-
tives) are extracted in order to form different
bag of word pairs with the joy, disgust, fear,
anger, sadness and surprise emotions. For
each pair, we compute the Mutual Informa-
tion Score which is obtained from the web
occurrences of an emotion and the content
words. Our approach is based on the hypoth-
esis that group of words which co-occur to-
gether across many documents with a given
emotion are highly probable to express the
same emotion.
