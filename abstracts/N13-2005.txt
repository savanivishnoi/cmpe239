Revealing an anonymous author?s traits from
text is a well-researched area. In this paper we
aim to identify the native language and lan-
guage family of a non-native English author,
given his/her English writings. We extract fea-
tures from the text based on prior work, and
extend or modify it to construct different fea-
ture sets, and use support vector machines for
classification. We show that native language
identification accuracy can be improved by up
to 6.43% for a 9-class task, depending on the
feature set, by introducing a novel method to
incorporate language family information. In
addition we show that introducing grammar-
based features improves accuracy of both na-
tive language and language family identifica-
tion.
