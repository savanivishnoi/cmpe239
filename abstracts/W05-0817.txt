 
We briefly describe a word alignment system 
that combines two different methods in bitext 
correspondences identification. The first one is 
a hypotheses testing approach (Gale and 
Church, 1991; Melamed, 2001; Tufi? 2002) 
while the second one is closer to a model 
estimating approach (Brown et al, 1993; Och 
and Ney, 2000). We show that combining the 
two aligners the results are significantly 
improved as compared to each individual 
aligner.
