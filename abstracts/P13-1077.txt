Modern phrase-based machine translation
systems make extensive use of word-
based translation models for inducing
alignments from parallel corpora. This
is problematic, as the systems are inca-
pable of accurately modelling many trans-
lation phenomena that do not decompose
into word-for-word translation. This pa-
per presents a novel method for induc-
ing phrase-based translation units directly
from parallel data, which we frame as
learning an inverse transduction grammar
(ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior.
Overall this leads to a model which learns
translations of entire sentences, while also
learning their decomposition into smaller
units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminat-
ing at word translations. Our experiments
on Arabic, Urdu and Farsi to English
demonstrate improvements over competi-
tive baseline systems.
