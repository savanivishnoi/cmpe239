This article presents the machine learning
approach used by the University of
Wolverhampton in the GREC-NEG?09
task. A classifier based on J48 decision
tree and a meta-classifier were used to
produce two runs. Evaluation on the
development set shows that the meta-
classifier achieves a better performance.
