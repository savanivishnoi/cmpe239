 
Chinese named entity recognition is one 
of the difficult and challenging tasks of 
NLP. In this paper, we present a Chinese 
named entity recognition system using a 
multi-phase model. First, we segment the 
text with a character-level CRF model. 
Then we apply three word-level CRF 
models to the labeling person names, lo-
cation names and organization names in 
the segmentation results, respectively. 
Our systems participated in the NER tests 
on open and closed tracks of  Microsoft 
Research (MSRA). The actual evaluation 
results show that our system performs 
well on both the open tracks and closed 
tracks.
