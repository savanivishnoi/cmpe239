 
This paper describes the specifications and 
results of UMCC_DLSI system, which 
participated in the Semantic Textual 
Similarity task (STS) of SemEval-2013. Our 
supervised system uses different types of 
lexical and semantic features to train a 
Bagging classifier used to decide the correct 
option. Related to the different features we 
can highlight the resource ISR-WN used to 
extract semantic relations among words and 
the use of different algorithms to establish 
semantic and lexical similarities. In order to 
establish which features are the most 
appropriate to improve STS results we 
participated with three runs using different 
set of features. Our best run reached the 
position 44 in the official ranking, obtaining 
a general correlation coefficient of 0.61.
