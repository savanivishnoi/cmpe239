This paper proposes an annotating
scheme that encodes honorifics
(respectful words). Honorifics are used
extensively in Japanese, reflecting the
social relationship (e.g. social ranks and
age) of the referents. This referential
information is vital for resolving zero
pronouns and improving machine
translation outputs. Annotating honorifics
is a complex task that involves
identifying a predicate with honorifics,
assigning ranks to referents of the
predicate, calibrating the ranks, and
connecting referents with their predicates.
