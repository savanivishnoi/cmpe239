information processing, and the performance 
of the segmenter, therefore, has a direct and 
great influence on the processing steps that 
follow. Different segmenters will give 
different results when handling issues like 
word boundary. And we will present in this 
paper that there is no need for an absolute 
definition of word boundary for all segmenters, 
and that different results of segmentation shall 
be acceptable if they can help to reach a 
correct syntactic analysis in the end.
