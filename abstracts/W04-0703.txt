 
Event clustering on streaming news aims to 
group documents by events automatically.  
This paper employs co-reference chains to 
extract the most representative sentences, and 
then uses them to select the most informative 
features for clustering.  Due to the long span 
of events, a fixed threshold approach prohibits 
the latter documents to be clustered and thus 
decreases the performance.  A dynamic 
threshold using time decay function and 
spanning window is proposed.  Besides the 
noun phrases in co-reference chains, event 
words in each sentence are also introduced to 
improve the related performance.  Two models 
are proposed.  The experimental results show 
that both event words and co-reference chains 
are useful on event clustering.
