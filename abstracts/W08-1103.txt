Information graphics, such as bar charts and
line graphs, play an important role in mul-
timodal documents. This paper presents a
novel approach to producing a brief textual
summary of a simple bar chart. It outlines
our approach to augmenting the core message
of the graphic to produce a brief summary.
Our method simultaneously constructs both
the discourse and sentence structures of the
textual summary using a bottom-up approach.
The result is then realized in natural language.
An evaluation study validates our generation
methodology.
