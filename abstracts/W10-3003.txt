In this paper we describe our approach
to the CoNLL-2010 shared task on de-
tecting speculative language in biomedical
text. We treat the detection of sentences
containing uncertain information (Task1)
as a token classification task since the
existence or absence of cues determines
the sentence label. We distinguish words
that have speculative and non-speculative
meaning by employing syntactic features
as a proxy for their semantic content. In
order to identify the scope of each cue
(Task2), we learn a classifier that predicts
whether each token of a sentence belongs
to the scope of a given cue. The features
in the classifier are based on the syntactic
dependency path between the cue and the
token. In both tasks, we use a Bayesian
logistic regression classifier incorporating
a sparsity-enforcing Laplace prior. Over-
all, the performance achieved is 85.21%
F-score and 44.11% F-score in Task1 and
Task2, respectively.
