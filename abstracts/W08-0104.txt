In this paper we define agreement in terms
of shared public commitments, and implicit
agreement is conditioned on the semantics of
the relational speech acts (e.g., Narration, Ex-
planation) that each agent performs. We pro-
vide a consistent interpretation of disputes,
and updating a logical form with the current
utterance always involves extending it and not
revising it, even if the current utterance denies
earlier content.
