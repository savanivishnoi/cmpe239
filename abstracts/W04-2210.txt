The motivation of the Papillon project is to
encourage the development of freely accessible
Multilingual Lexical Resources by way of on-
line collaborative work on the Internet. For this,
we developed a generic community website orig-
inally dedicated to the diffusion and the devel-
opment of a particular acception based multilin-
gual lexical database.
The generic aspect of our platform allows
its use for the development of other lexical
databases. Adapting it to a new lexical database
is a matter of description of its structures and
interfaces by way of XML files. In this paper, we
show how we already adapted it to other very
different lexical databases. We also show what
future developments should be done in order to
gather several lexical databases developers in a
common network.
