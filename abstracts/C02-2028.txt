  
This paper presents an extended GLR 
parsing algorithm with grammar PCFG* that 
is based on Tomita?s GLR parsing algorithm 
and extends it further. We also define a new 
grammar?PCFG* that is based on PCFG 
and assigns not only probability but also 
frequency associated with each rule. So our 
syntactic parsing system is implemented 
based on rule-based approach and statistics 
approach. Furthermore our experiments are 
executed in two fields: Chinese base noun 
phrase identification and full syntactic 
parsing. And the results of these two fields 
are compared from three ways. The 
experiments prove that the extended GLR 
parsing algorithm with PCFG* is an 
efficient parsing method and a 
straightforward way to combine statistical 
property with rules. The experiment results 
of these two fields are presented in this 
paper.
