 
We present a model and an experimental 
platform of a bootstrapping approach to 
statistical induction of natural language 
properties that is constraint based with voting 
components. The system is incremental and 
unsupervised. In the following discussion we 
focus on the components for morphological 
induction. We show that the much harder 
problem of incremental unsupervised 
morphological induction can outperform 
comparable all-at-once algorithms with 
respect to precision. We discuss how we use 
such systems to identify cues for induction in 
a cross-level architecture.
