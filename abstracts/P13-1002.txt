 
Since statistical machine translation (SMT) 
and translation memory (TM) complement 
each other in matched and unmatched regions, 
integrated models are proposed in this paper to 
incorporate TM information into phrase-based 
SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline 
approaches, which directly merge TM result 
into the final output, the proposed models refer 
to the corresponding TM information associat-
ed with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a 
Chinese?English TM database, our experi-
ments show that the proposed integrated Mod-
el-III is significantly better than either the 
SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match 
score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated 
Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points 
improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction 
in comparison with the pure SMT system. Be-
sides, the proposed models also outperform 
previous approaches significantly.
