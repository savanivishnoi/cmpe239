 
This paper reports an investigation of the 
turn-taking functions of drawings in 
graphical communication.  Based on the 
examination of dialogue data collected that 
involve collaborative drawing interactions, 
as well as spoken dialogue interactions, in a 
joint problem solving task, we found that 
?drawing turns,? in which the drawer 
presents a piece of information to her 
partner through drawing, had almost the 
same turn-keeping effects as ?speech turns.?
