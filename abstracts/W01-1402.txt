We describe MSR-MT, a large-scale
hybrid machine translation system
under development for several
language pairs. This system?s ability to
acquire its primary translation
knowledge automatically by parsing a
bilingual corpus of hundreds of
thousands of sentence pairs and
aligning resulting logical forms
demonstrates true promise for
overcoming the so-called MT
customization bottleneck. Trained on
English and Spanish technical prose, a
blind evaluation shows that MSR-MT?s
integration of rule-based parsers,
example based processing, and
statistical techniques produces
translations whose quality exceeds that
of uncustomized commercial MT
systems in this domain.
