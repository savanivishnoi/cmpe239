While sentence extraction as an approach to
summarization has been shown to work in docu-
ments of certain genres, because of the conver-
sational nature of email communication where
utterances are made in relation to one made
previously, sentence extraction may not capture
the necessary segments of dialogue that would
make a summary coherent. In this paper, we
present our work on the detection of question-
answer pairs in an email conversation for the
task of email summarization. We show that var-
ious features based on the structure of email-
threads can be used to improve upon lexical
similarity of discourse segments for question-
answer pairing.
