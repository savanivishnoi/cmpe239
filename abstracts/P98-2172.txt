 
A model for reference use in com- 
munication is proposed, from a rep- 
resentationist point of view. Both the 
sender and the receiver of a message 
handle representations of their com- 
mon environment, including mental 
representations of objects. Reference 
resolution by a computer is viewed as 
the construction of object representa- 
tions using referring expressions from 
the discourse, whereas often only 
coreference links between such ex- 
pressions are looked for. Differences 
between these two approaches are 
discussed. 
The model has been imple- 
mented with elementary rules, and 
tested on complex narrative texts 
(hundreds to thousands of referring 
expressions). The results support the 
mental representations paradigm.
