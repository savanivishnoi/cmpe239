 
Logic Forms, particular powerful logic 
representations presented in Moldovan 
and Rus (2001), are simple yet highly ef-
fective. In this paper, the structure of 
Logic Forms and their generation from 
input text are described. The results of an 
evaluation comparing the Logic Forms 
generated by hand with those generated 
automatically are also reported. Finally, 
we suggest some improvements to the 
representation used in the LFI task based 
on our results.
