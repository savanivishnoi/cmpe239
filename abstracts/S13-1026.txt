This paper describes our system entered for the
*SEM 2013 shared task on Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS). We focus on the core task
of predicting the semantic textual similarity of
sentence pairs.
The current system utilizes machine learn-
ing techniques trained on semantic similarity
ratings from the *SEM 2012 shared task; it
achieved rank 20 out of 90 submissions from
35 different teams. Given the simple nature of
our approach, which uses only WordNet and
unannotated corpus data as external resources,
we consider this a remarkably good result, mak-
ing the system an interesting tool for a wide
range of practical applications.
