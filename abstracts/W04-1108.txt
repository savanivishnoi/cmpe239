 
The input of network is the key problem for 
Chinese Word sense disambiguation utilizing 
the Neural Network. This paper presents an 
input model of Neural Network that calculates 
the Mutual Information between contextual 
words and ambiguous word by using statistical 
method and taking the contextual words to 
certain number beside the ambiguous word 
according to (-M, +N). The experiment adopts 
triple-layer BP Neural Network model and 
proves how the size of training set and the 
value of M and N affect the performance of 
Neural Network model. The experimental 
objects are six pseudowords owning three 
word-senses constructed according to certain 
principles. Tested accuracy of our approach on 
a close-corpus reaches 90.31%,, and 89.62% on 
a open-corpus. The experiment proves that the 
Neural Network model has good performance 
on Word sense disambiguation.
