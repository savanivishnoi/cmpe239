This paper describes an initial version of a
general purpose French/English statistical ma-
chine translation system. The main features
of this system are the open-source Moses de-
coder, the integration of a bilingual dictionary
and a continuous space target language model.
We analyze the performance of this system on
the test data of the WMT?08 evaluation.
