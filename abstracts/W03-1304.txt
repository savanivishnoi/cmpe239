 
Named entity recognition is a fundamental task in 
biological relationship mining.  This paper 
employs protein collocates extracted from a 
biological corpus to enhance the performance of 
protein name recognizers.  Yapex and KeX are 
taken as examples.  The precision of Yapex is 
increased from 70.90% to 81.94% at the low 
expense of recall rate (i.e., only decrease 2.39%) 
when collocates are incorporated.  We also 
integrate the results proposed by Yapex and KeX, 
and employs collocates to filter the merged results.  
Because the candidates suggested by these two 
systems may be inconsistent, i.e., overlap in partial, 
one of them is considered as a basis.  The 
experiments show that Yapex-based integration is 
better than KeX-based integration.
