 
This paper presents an algorithm for selecting an 
appropriate classifier word for a noun. In Thai 
language, it frequently happens that there is fluctuation 
in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun, 
both from the point of view of the whole speech 
community and individual speakers. Basically, there is 
no exact rule for classifier selection. As far as we can 
do in the rule~based approach is to give a default rule 
to pick up a corresponding classifier of each noun. 
Registration of classifier for each noun is limited to the 
type of unit classifier because other types ,are open due 
to the meaning of representation. We propose a 
corpus-based method (Biber,1993; Nagao,1993; 
Smadja,1993) which generates Noun Classifier 
Associations (NCA) to overcome the problems in 
classifier assignment and semantic construction of 
noun phrase. The NCA is created statistically from a 
large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy 
constraints and frequency of occurrences. 
Keywords: Thai language, classifier, corpus-based 
method, Noun Classifier Associations (NCA)
