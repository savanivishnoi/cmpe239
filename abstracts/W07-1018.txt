 
We propose a methodology using 
underspecified semantic interpretation to 
process comparative constructions in 
MEDLINE citations, concentrating on two 
structures that are prevalent in the research 
literature reporting on clinical trials for 
drug therapies. The method exploits an 
existing semantic processor, SemRep, 
which constructs predications based on the 
Unified Medical Language System. Results 
of a preliminary evaluation were recall of 
70%, precision of 96%, and F-score of 
81%. We discuss the generalization of the 
methodology to other entities such as 
therapeutic and diagnostic procedures. The 
available structures in computable format 
are potentially useful for interpreting 
outcome statements in MEDLINE 
citations.
