The orthographical complexity of Chinese,
Japanese and Korean (CJK) poses a special
challenge to the developers of computational
linguistic tools, especially in the area of
intelligent information retrieval. These
difficulties are exacerbated by the lack of a
standardized orthography in these languages,
especially the highly irregular Japanese
orthography. This paper focuses on the typology
of CJK orthographic variation, provides a brief
analysis of the linguistic issues, and discusses why
lexical databases should play a central role in the
disambiguation process.
