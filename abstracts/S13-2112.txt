In this paper, we present our approach to
SemEval-2013 Task 9.2. It is a feature rich
classification using LIBSVM for Drug-Drug
Interactions detection in the BioMedical do-
main. The features are extracted considering
morphosyntactic, lexical and semantic con-
cepts. Tools like openDMAP and TEES are
used to extract semantic concepts from the
corpus. The best F-score that we got for Drug-
Drug Interaction (DDI) detection is 50% and
61% and the best F-score for DDI detection
and classification is 34% and 48% for test and
development data respectively.
Keywords: text mining, event extraction, ma-
chine learning, feature extraction.
