Keyword-matching systems based on
simple models of semantic relatedness
are inadequate at modelling the ambigu-
ities in natural language text, and cannot
reliably address the increasingly com-
plex information needs of users. In
this paper we propose novel methods
for computing semantic relatedness by
spreading activation energy over the hy-
perlink structure of Wikipedia. We
demonstrate that our techniques can
approach state-of-the-art performance,
while requiring only a fraction of the
background data.
