We present a new translation model
that include undecorated hierarchical-style
phrase rules, decorated source-syntax
rules, and partially decorated rules.
Results show an increase in translation
performance of up to 0.8% BLEU for
German?English translation when trained
on the news-commentary corpus, using
syntactic annotation from a source lan-
guage parser. We also experimented with
annotation from shallow taggers and found
this increased performance by 0.5% BLEU.
