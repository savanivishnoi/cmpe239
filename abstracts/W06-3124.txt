The  Microsoft  Research  translation  system  is  a
syntactically  informed  phrasal  SMT  system  that
uses  a  phrase  translation  model  based  on
dependency treelets and a global reordering model
based  on  the  source  dependency  tree.  These
models  are  combined  with  several  other
knowledge  sources  in  a  log-linear  manner.  The
weights of the individual components in the log-
linear model  are set  by an automatic  parameter-
tuning method.  We give a brief  overview of the
components  of  the  system  and  discuss  our
experience with the Europarl data translating from
English to Spanish.
