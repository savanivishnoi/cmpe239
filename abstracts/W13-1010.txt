 
This paper presents a supervised machine 
learning approach that uses a machine learn-
ing algorithm called Random Forest for rec-
ognition of Bengali noun-noun compounds as 
multiword expression (MWE) from Bengali 
corpus. Our proposed approach to MWE rec-
ognition has two steps: (1) extraction of can-
didate multi-word expressions using Chunk 
information and various heuristic rules and (2) 
training the machine learning algorithm to 
recognize a candidate multi-word expression 
as Multi-word expression or not. A variety of 
association measures, syntactic and linguistic 
clues are used as features for identifying 
MWEs. The proposed system is tested on a 
Bengali corpus for identifying noun-noun 
compound MWEs from the corpus.
