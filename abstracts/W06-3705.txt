This position paper looks critically at a
number of aspects of current research into
spoken language translation (SLT) in the
medical domain. We first discuss the user
profile for medical SLT, criticizing de-
signs which assume that the doctor will
necessarily need or want to control the
technology. If patients are to be users on
an equal standing, more attention must be
paid to usability issues. We focus briefly
on the issue of feedback in SLT systems,
pointing out the difficulties of relying on
text-based paraphrases. We consider the
delicate issue of evaluating medical SLT
systems, noting that some of the standard
and much-used evaluation techniques for
all aspects of the SLT chain might not be
suitable for use with real users, even if
they are role-playing. Finally, we discuss
the idea that the ?pathway to healthcare?
involves much more than a face-to-face in-
terview with a medical professional, and
that different technologies including but
not restricted to SLT will be appropriate
along this pathway.
