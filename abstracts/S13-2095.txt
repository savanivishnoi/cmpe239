This paper describes the NILC USP system
that participated in SemEval-2013 Task 2:
Sentiment Analysis in Twitter. Our system
adopts a hybrid classification process that
uses three classification approaches: rule-
based, lexicon-based and machine learning
approaches. We suggest a pipeline architec-
ture that extracts the best characteristics from
each classifier. Our system achieved an F-
score of 56.31% in the Twitter message-level
subtask.
