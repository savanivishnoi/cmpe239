 
In this paper, we describe a means for automatically building very large neural networks 
(VLNNs) from definition texts in machine-readable dictionaries, and demonslrate he use of 
these networks for word sense disambiguation. Our method brings together two earlier, 
independent approaches to word sense disambiguation: the use of machine-readable 
dictionaries and spreading and activation models. The automatic construction of VLNNs 
enables real-size xperiments with neural networks for natural language processing, which in 
turn provides insight into their behavior and design and can lead to possible improvements.
