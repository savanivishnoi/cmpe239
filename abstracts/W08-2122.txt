We propose a solution to the challenge
of the CoNLL 2008 shared task that uses
a generative history-based latent variable
model to predict the most likely derivation
of a synchronous dependency parser for
both syntactic and semantic dependencies.
The submitted model yields 79.1% macro-
average F1 performance, for the joint task,
86.9% syntactic dependencies LAS and
71.0% semantic dependencies F1. A larger
model trained after the deadline achieves
80.5% macro-average F1, 87.6% syntac-
tic dependencies LAS, and 73.1% seman-
tic dependencies F1.
