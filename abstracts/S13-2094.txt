This paper describes the systems with which
we participated in the task Sentiment Analysis
in Twitter of SEMEVAL 2013 and specifically
the Message Polarity Classification. We used
a 2-stage pipeline approach employing a lin-
ear SVM classifier at each stage and several
features including BOW features, POS based
features and lexicon based features. We have
also experimented with Naive Bayes classi-
fiers trained with BOW features.
