This  paper  presents  Thai  syntactic  re-
source:  Thai  CG treebank,  a  categorial 
approach  of  language  resources.  Since 
there  are  very  few  Thai  syntactic  re-
sources,  we designed to create treebank 
based on CG formalism. Thai corpus was 
parsed  with  existing  CG  syntactic  dic-
tionary  and  LALR  parser.  The  correct 
parsed trees were collected as prelimin-
ary  CG  treebank.  It  consists  of  50,346 
trees  from 27,239 utterances.  Trees  can 
be  split  into  three  grammatical  types. 
There are 12,876 sentential trees, 13,728 
noun  phrasal  trees,  and  18,342  verb 
phrasal trees. There are 17,847 utterances 
that obtain one tree, and an average tree 
per an utterance is 1.85.
