 
Spelling-checkers have become an integral part 
of most text processing software. From different rea- 
sons among which the speed of processing prevails 
they are usually based on dictionaries of word forms 
instead of words. This approach is sufficient for 
languages with little inflection such as English, but fails 
for highly inflective languages such as Czech, Russian, 
Slovak or other Slavonic languages. We have 
developed a special method for describing inflection 
for the purpose of building spelling-checkers for such 
languages. The speed of the resulting program lies 
somewhere in the middle of the scale of existing 
spelling-checkers for English and the main dictionary 
fits into the standard 360K floppy, whereas the number 
of recognized word forms exceeds 6 million (for 
Czech). Further, a special method has been developed 
for easy word classification.
