We present a supervised sentiment detection
system that classifies the polarity of subjec-
tive phrases as positive, negative, or neutral. It
is tailored towards online genres, specifically
Twitter, through the inclusion of dictionaries
developed to capture vocabulary used in on-
line conversations (e.g., slang and emoticons)
as well as stylistic features common to social
media. We show how to incorporate these
new features within a state of the art system
and evaluate it on subtask A in SemEval-2013
Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter.
