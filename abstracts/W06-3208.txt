For a language with limited resources, a
dictionary may be one of the few available
electronic resources. To make effective
use of the dictionary for translation, how-
ever, users must be able to access it us-
ing the root form of morphologically de-
formed variant found in the text. Stem-
ming and data driven methods, however,
are not suitable when data is sparse. We
present algorithms for discovering mor-
phemes from limited, noisy data obtained
by scanning a hard copy dictionary. Our
approach is based on the novel applica-
tion of the longest common substring and
string edit distance metrics. Results show
that these algorithms can in fact segment
words into roots and affixes from the lim-
ited data contained in a dictionary, and ex-
tract affixes. This in turn allows non na-
tive speakers to perform multilingual tasks
for applications where response must be
rapid, and their knowledge is limited. In
addition, this analysis can feed other NLP
tools requiring lexicons.
