ACL 2010 NEWS workshop shared translitera-
tion mining task data.  Transliteration mining 
was done using a generative transliteration model 
applied on the source language and whose output 
was constrained on the words in the target lan-
guage.  A total of 30 runs were performed on 5 
language pairs, with 6 runs for each language 
pair.  In the presence of limited resources, the 
runs explored the use of phonetic conflation and 
iterative training of the transliteration model to 
improve recall.  Using letter conflation improved 
recall by as much as 48%, with improvements in 
recall dwarfing drops in precision.  Using itera-
tive training improved recall, but often at the cost 
of significant drops in precision.  The best runs 
typically used both letter conflation and iterative 
learning.
