It is possible to reduce the bulk of phrase-
tables for Statistical Machine Translation us-
ing a technique based on the significance
testing of phrase pair co-occurrence in the
parallel corpus. The savings can be quite
substantial (up to 90%) and cause no reduc-
tion in BLEU score. In some cases, an im-
provement in BLEU is obtained at the same
time although the effect is less pronounced
if state-of-the-art phrasetable smoothing is
employed.
