 
This paper describes the results of 
some experiments exploring statistical 
methods to infer syntactic categories 
from a raw corpus in an unsupervised 
fashion. It shares certain points in 
common with Brown et at (1992) and 
work that has grown out of that: it 
employs statistical techniques to 
derive categories based on what 
words occur adjacent to a given word. 
However, we use an eigenvector 
decomposition of a nearest-neighbor 
graph to produce a two-dimensional 
rendering of the words of a corpus in 
which words of the same syntactic 
category tend to form clusters and 
neighborhoods. We exploit this 
technique for extending the value of 
automatic learning of morphology. In 
particular, we look at the suffixes 
derived from a corpus by 
unsupervised learning of morphology, 
and we ask which of these suffixes 
have a consistent syntactic function 
(e.g., in English, -ed is primarily a 
mark of verbal past tense, does but ?s 
marks both noun plurals and 3rd 
person present on verbs).
