The validity of semantic inferences depends
on the contexts in which they are applied.
We propose a generic framework for handling
contextual considerations within applied in-
ference, termed Contextual Preferences. This
framework defines the various context-aware
components needed for inference and their
relationships. Contextual preferences extend
and generalize previous notions, such as se-
lectional preferences, while experiments show
that the extended framework allows improving
inference quality on real application data.
