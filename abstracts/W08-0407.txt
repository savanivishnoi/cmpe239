We describe experiments on discriminating
English to French phrase-based translations
through the use of syntactic ?coupling? fea-
tures. Using a robust rule-based dependency
parser, we parse both the English source and
the French translation candidates from the n-
best list returned by our phrase-based system;
we compute for each candidate a number of
coupling features, that is, values that depend
on the amount of alignment between edges in
the source and target structures, and discrim-
inatively train the weights of these coupling
features. We compare different feature combi-
nations. Although the improvements in terms
of automatic measures such as Bleu and Nist
are inconclusive, an initial human assessment
of the results appears to show certain qualita-
tive improvements.
