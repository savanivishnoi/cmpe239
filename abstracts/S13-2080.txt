This paper describes the system implemented
by Fundacio? Barcelona Media (FBM) for clas-
sifying the polarity of opinion expressions in
tweets and SMSs, and which is supported by
a UIMA pipeline for rich linguistic and sen-
timent annotations. FBM participated in the
SEMEVAL 2013 Task 2 on polarity classifi-
cation. It ranked 5th in Task A (constrained
track) using an ensemble system combining
ML algorithms with dictionary-based heuris-
tics, and 7th (Task B, constrained) using an
SVM classifier with features derived from the
linguistic annotations and some heuristics.
