This paper presents the UNITOR system that
participated in the *SEM 2013 shared task on
Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). The task is
modeled as a Support Vector (SV) regression
problem, where a similarity scoring function
between text pairs is acquired from examples.
The proposed approach has been implemented
in a system that aims at providing high ap-
plicability and robustness, in order to reduce
the risk of over-fitting over a specific datasets.
Moreover, the approach does not require any
manually coded resource (e.g. WordNet), but
mainly exploits distributional analysis of un-
labeled corpora. A good level of accuracy is
achieved over the shared task: in the Typed
STS task the proposed system ranks in 1st and
2nd position.
