A dialogue system can present itself and/or
address the user as an active agent by means
of linguistic constructions in personal style, or
suppress agentivity by using impersonal style.
We compare system evaluation judgments and
input style alignment of users interacting with
an in-car dialogue system generating output in
personal vs. impersonal style. Although our
results are consistent with earlier findings ob-
tained with simulated systems, the effects are
weaker.
