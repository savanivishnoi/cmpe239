We describe an approach to domain adapta-
tion that is appropriate exactly in the case
when one has enough ?target? data to do
slightly better than just using only ?source?
data. Our approach is incredibly simple,
easy to implement as a preprocessing step
(10 lines of Perl!) and outperforms state-
of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets.
Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-
domain adaptation problem, where one has
data from a variety of different domains.
