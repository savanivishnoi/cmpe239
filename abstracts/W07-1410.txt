This paper describes our experiments on
Textual Entailment in the context of the
Third Pascal Recognising Textual Entail-
ment (RTE-3) Evaluation Challenge. Our
system uses a Machine Learning approach
with Support Vector Machines and Ad-
aBoost to deal with the RTE challenge. We
perform a lexical, syntactic, and semantic
analysis of the entailment pairs . From this
information we compute a set of semantic-
based distances between sentences. The re-
sults look promising specially for the QA en-
tailment task.
