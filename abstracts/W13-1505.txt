The purpose of this paper is to motivate and
describe a system that simplifies numerical
expression in texts, along with an evaluation
study in which experts in numeracy and liter-
acy assessed the outputs of this system. We
have worked with a collection of newspaper
articles with a significant number of numerical
expressions. The results are discussed in com-
parison to conclusions obtained from a prior
empirical survey.
