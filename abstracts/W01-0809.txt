This paper presents the implementation
of the Vietnamese generation module
in ITS3, a multilingual machine
translation (MT) system based on the
Government & Binding (GB) theory.
Despite well-designed generic
mechanisms of the system, it turned out
that the task of generating Vietnamese
posed non-trivial problems. We
therefore had to deviate from the
generic code and make new design and
implementation in many important
cases. By developing corresponding
bilingual lexicons, we obtained
prototypes of French-Vietnamese and
English-Vietnamese MT, the former
being the first known prototype of this
kind. Our experience suggests that in a
principle-based generation system, the
parameterized modules, which contain
language-specific and lexicalized
properties, deserve more attention, and
the generic mechanisms should be
flexible enough to facilitate the
integration of these modules.
