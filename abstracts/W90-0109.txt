Abstract 
In this paper, I define the notion of an abstract 
linguistic resource which reifies as a term for use by 
the text planner just those combinations of concrete 
linguistic resources (the words, morphological 
markings, syntactic structures, etc. that actually 
appear in a stream of text) that are expressible. I
present a representational level, the Text Structure, 
which is defined in these abstract linguistic terms 
and which mediates and constrains the commitments 
of a text planner to ensure that the utterance being 
planned will be expressible in language.
