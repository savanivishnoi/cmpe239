This paper describes our system as used in
the RTE3 task. The system maps premise and
hypothesis pairs into an abstract knowledge
representation (AKR) and then performs en-
tailment and contradiction detection (ECD)
on the resulting AKRs. Two versions of ECD
were used in RTE3, one with strict ECD and
one with looser ECD.
