We describe the LIMSI system for the
SemEval-2013 Cross-lingual Word Sense Dis-
ambiguation (CLWSD) task. Word senses are
represented by means of translation clusters
in different languages built by a cross-lingual
Word Sense Induction (WSI) method. Our
CLWSD classifier exploits the WSI output for
selecting appropriate translations for target
words in context. We present the design of the
system and the obtained results.
