This  paper  describes  the  architecture  of  an 
encoding system which aim is to be implemented 
as  a  coding  help  at  the  Cliniques  universtaires  
Saint-Luc,  a  hospital  in  Brussels.  This  paper 
focuses  on  machine  learning  methods,  more 
specifically, on the appropriate set of attributes to 
be chosen in order to optimize the results of these 
methods.  A  series  of  four  experiments  was 
conducted  on  a  baseline  method:  Na?ve  Bayes 
with varying sets of attributes. These experiments 
showed that a first step consisting in the extraction 
of   information  to  be  coded  (such  as  diseases, 
procedures,  aggravating factors, etc.) is essential. 
It  also demonstrated the importance of stemming 
features.  Restraining  the  classes  to  categories 
resulted in a recall of  81.1 %.
