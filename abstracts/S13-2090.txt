Using labeled Twitter training data from
SemEval-2013, we train both a subjectivity
classifier and a polarity classifier separately,
and then combine the two into a single hier-
archical classifier. Using additional unlabeled
data that is believed to contain sentiment, we
allow the polarity classifier to continue learn-
ing using self-training. The resulting system is
capable of classifying a document as neutral,
positive, or negative with an overall accuracy
of 61.2% using our hierarchical Naive Bayes
classifier.1
