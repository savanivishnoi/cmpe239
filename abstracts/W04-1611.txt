 
This paper offers a transcription system for 
Persian, the target language in the Transonics 
project, a speech-to-speech translation system 
developed as a part of the DARPA Babylon 
program (The DARPA Babylon Program; 
Narayanan, 2003).  In this paper, we discuss 
transcription systems needed for automated 
spoken language processing applications in 
Persian that uses the Arabic script for writing.  
This system can easily be modified for Arabic, 
Dari, Urdu and any other language that uses 
the Arabic script. The proposed system has 
two components. One is a phonemic based 
transcription of sounds for acoustic modelling 
in Automatic Speech Recognizers and for Text 
to Speech synthesizer, using ASCII based 
symbols, rather than International Phonetic 
Alphabet symbols.  The other is a hybrid 
system that provides a minimally-ambiguous 
lexical representation that explicitly includes 
vocalic information; such a representation is 
needed for language modelling, text to speech 
synthesis and machine translation.
