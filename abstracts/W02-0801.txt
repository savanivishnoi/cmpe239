 
This paper presents preliminary 
experiments in the use of translation 
equivalences to disambiguate 
prepositions or case suffixes. The core 
of the method is to find translations of 
the occurrence of the target preposition 
or case suffix, and assign the 
intersection of their set of 
interpretations. Given a table with 
prepositions and their possible 
interpretations, the method is fully 
automatic. We have tested this method 
on the occurrences of the Basque 
instrumental case -z in the definitions of 
a Basque dictionary, looking for the 
translations in the definitions from 3 
Spanish and 3 English dictionaries. The 
results have been that we are able to 
disambiguate with 94.5% accuracy 
2.3% of those occurrences (up to 91). 
The ambiguity is reduced from 7 
readings down to 3.1. The results are 
very encouraging given the simple 
techniques used, and show great 
potential for improvement.
