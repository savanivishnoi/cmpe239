We describe an algebraic approach for
computing with vector based semantics.
The tensor product has been proposed as
a method of composition, but has the un-
desirable property that strings of different
length are incomparable. We consider how
a quotient algebra of the tensor algebra can
allow such comparisons to be made, offer-
ing the possibility of data-driven models of
semantic composition.
