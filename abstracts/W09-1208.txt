This paper describes our system about mul-
tilingual semantic dependency parsing (SR-
Lonly) for our participation in the shared task
of CoNLL-2009. We illustrate that semantic
dependency parsing can be transformed into
a word-pair classification problem and im-
plemented as a single-stage machine learning
system. For each input corpus, a large scale
feature engineering is conducted to select the
best fit feature template set incorporated with a
proper argument pruning strategy. The system
achieved the top average score in the closed
challenge: 80.47% semantic labeled F1 for the
average score.
