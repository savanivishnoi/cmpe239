  
The paper presents a statistical approach to 
automatic building of translation lexicons 
from parallel corpora. We briefly describe 
the pre-processing steps, a baseline iterative 
method, and the actual algorithm. The 
evaluation for the two algorithms is 
presented in some detail in terms of 
precision, recall and processing time.  We 
conclude by briefly presenting some of our 
applications of the multilingual lexicons 
extracted by the method described herein.
