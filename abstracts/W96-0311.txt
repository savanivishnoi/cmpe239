 
In this paper we outline a lexical organization for Turkish that makes use of lexical rules for inflec- 
tions, derivations, and lexical category changes to control the proliferation of lexical entries. Lexical 
rules handle changes in grammatical roles, enforce type constraints, and control the mapping of sub- 
categorization frames in valency changing operations. A lexical inheritance hierarchy facilitates the 
enforcement of type constraints. Semantic ompositions in inflections and derivations are constrained 
by the properties of the terms and predicates. 
The design has been tested as part of a HPSG grammar for Turkish. In terms of performance, 
run-time xecution of the rules seems to be a far better alternative than pre-compilation. The latter causes 
exponential growth in the lexicon due to intensive use of inflections and derivations in Turkish.
