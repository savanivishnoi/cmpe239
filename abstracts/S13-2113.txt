This paper presents UoS, a graph-based Word
Sense Induction system which attempts to
find all applicable senses of a target word
given its context, grading each sense accord-
ing to its suitability to the context. Senses
of a target word are induced through use of
a non-parameterised, linear-time clustering al-
gorithm that returns maximal quasi-strongly
connected components of a target word graph
in which vertex pairs are assigned to the same
cluster if either vertex has the highest edge
weight to the other. UoS participated in
SemEval-2013 Task 13: Word Sense Induc-
tion for Graded and Non-Graded Senses. Two
system were submitted; both systems returned
results comparable with those of the best per-
forming systems.
