 
In experiments on a natural language 
information retrieval system that retrieves 
images based on textual captions, we show 
that syntactic complexity actually aids 
retrieval. We compare two types of 
captioned images, those characterized with 
full sentences in English, and those 
characterized by lists of words and phrases. 
The full-sentence captions show a 15% 
increase in retrieval accuracy over the word- 
list captions. We conclude that the syntactic 
complexity may be of use in fact because it 
decreases semantic ambiguity: the word-list 
captions may be syntactically simple, but 
they are semantically confusingly complex.
