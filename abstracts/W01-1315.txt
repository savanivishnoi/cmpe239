The aim of this paper is to present
a language-neutral, theory-neutral
method for annotating sentence-
internal temporal relations. The
annotation method is simple and
can be applied without special
training. The annotations are
provided with a well-defined
model-theoretic interpretation for
use in the content-based
comparison of annotations.
Temporally annotated corpora
have a number of applications, in
lexicon/induction, translation and
linguistic investigation. A
searchable multi-language
database has already been created.
