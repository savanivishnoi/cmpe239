 
The paper presents a method for word sense 
disambiguation based on parallel corpora. The 
method exploits recent advances in word 
alignment and word clustering based on 
automatic extraction of translation equivalents 
and being supported by available aligned 
wordnets for the languages in the corpus. The 
wordnets are aligned to the Princeton 
Wordnet, according to the principles 
established by EuroWordNet. The evaluation 
of the WSD system, implementing the 
method described herein showed very 
encouraging results. The same system used in 
a validation mode, can be used to check and 
spot alignment errors in multilingually 
aligned wordnets as BalkaNet and 
EuroWordNet.
