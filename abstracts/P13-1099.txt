In this paper, we propose a bigram based
supervised method for extractive docu-
ment summarization in the integer linear
programming (ILP) framework. For each
bigram, a regression model is used to es-
timate its frequency in the reference sum-
mary. The regression model uses a vari-
ety of indicative features and is trained dis-
criminatively to minimize the distance be-
tween the estimated and the ground truth
bigram frequency in the reference sum-
mary. During testing, the sentence selec-
tion problem is formulated as an ILP prob-
lem to maximize the bigram gains. We
demonstrate that our system consistently
outperforms the previous ILP method on
different TAC data sets, and performs
competitively compared to the best results
in the TAC evaluations. We also con-
ducted various analysis to show the im-
pact of bigram selection, weight estima-
tion, and ILP setup.
