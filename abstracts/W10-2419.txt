 
 
Named Entity Recognition or Extraction 
(NER) is an important task for automated text 
processing for industries and academia 
engaged in the field of language processing, 
intelligence gathering and Bioinformatics.  In 
this paper we discuss the general problem of 
Named Entity Recognition, more specifically 
the challenges in NER in languages that do not 
have language resources e.g. large annotated 
corpora. We specifically address the 
challenges for Urdu NER and differentiate it 
from other South Asian (Indic) languages. We 
discuss the differences between Hindi and 
Urdu and conclude that the NER 
computational models for Hindi cannot be 
applied to Urdu. A rule-based Urdu NER 
algorithm is presented that outperforms the 
models that use statistical learning.
