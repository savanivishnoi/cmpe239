We demonstrate that relational features
derived from dependency-syntactic and
semantic role structures are useful for the
task of detecting opinionated expressions
in natural-language text, significantly im-
proving over conventional models based
on sequence labeling with local features.
These features allow us to model the way
opinionated expressions interact in a sen-
tence over arbitrary distances.
While the relational features make the pre-
diction task more computationally expen-
sive, we show that it can be tackled effec-
tively by using a reranker. We evaluate
a number of machine learning approaches
for the reranker, and the best model re-
sults in a 10-point absolute improvement
in soft recall on the MPQA corpus, while
decreasing precision only slightly.
