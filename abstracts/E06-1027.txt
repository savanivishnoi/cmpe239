Many of the tasks required for semantic
tagging of phrases and texts rely on a list
of words annotated with some semantic
features. We present a method for ex-
tracting sentiment-bearing adjectives from
WordNet using the Sentiment Tag Extrac-
tion Program (STEP). We did 58 STEP
runs on unique non-intersecting seed lists
drawn from manually annotated list of
positive and negative adjectives and evalu-
ated the results against other manually an-
notated lists. The 58 runs were then col-
lapsed into a single set of 7, 813 unique
words. For each word we computed a
Net Overlap Score by subtracting the total
number of runs assigning this word a neg-
ative sentiment from the total of the runs
that consider it positive. We demonstrate
that Net Overlap Score can be used as a
measure of the words degree of member-
ship in the fuzzy category of sentiment:
the core adjectives, which had the high-
est Net Overlap scores, were identified
most accurately both by STEP and by hu-
man annotators, while the words on the
periphery of the category had the lowest
scores and were associated with low rates
of inter-annotator agreement.
