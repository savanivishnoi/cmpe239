In this paper, we describe our system for the
SemEval-2013 Task 2, Sentiment Analysis in
Twitter. We formed features that take into ac-
count the context of the expression and take a
supervised approach towards subjectivity and
polarity classification. Experiments were per-
formed on the features to find out whether
they were more suited for subjectivity or po-
larity Classification. We tested our model for
sentiment polarity classification on Twitter as
well as SMS chat expressions, analyzed their
F-measure scores and drew some interesting
conclusions from them.
