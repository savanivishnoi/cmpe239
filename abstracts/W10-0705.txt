We use Amazon Mechanical Turk to rate
computer-generated reading comprehension
questions about Wikipedia articles. Such
application-specific ratings can be used to
train statistical rankers to improve systems?
final output, or to evaluate technologies that
generate natural language. We discuss the
question rating scheme we developed, assess
the quality of the ratings that we gathered
through Amazon Mechanical Turk, and show
evidence that these ratings can be used to im-
prove question generation.
