CLaC-CORE, an exhaustive feature combina-
tion system ranked 4th among 34 teams in the
Semantic Textual Similarity shared task STS
2013. Using a core set of 11 lexical features
of the most basic kind, it uses a support vector
regressor which uses a combination of these
lexical features to train a model for predicting
similarity between sentences in a two phase
method, which in turn uses all combinations
of the features in the feature space and trains
separate models based on each combination.
Then it creates a meta-feature space and trains
a final model based on that. This two step pro-
cess improves the results achieved by single-
layer standard learning methodology over the
same simple features. We analyze the correla-
tion of feature combinations with the data sets
over which they are effective.
