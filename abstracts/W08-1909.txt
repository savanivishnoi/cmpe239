 
ETAP-3 is a system of machine 
translation consisting of various types of 
rules and dictionaries. Those dictionaries, 
being created especially for NLP system, 
provide for every lexeme not only data 
about its characteristics as a separate 
item, but also different types of 
information about its syntactic and 
semantic links to other lexemes.  
The paper shows how the information 
about certain types of semantic links 
between lexemes represented in the 
dictionaries can be used in a machine 
translation system. The paper deals with 
correspondences between lexical-
functional constructions of different types 
in the Russian and the English languages.  
Lexical-functional construction is a 
word-combination consisting of an 
argument of a lexical function and a value 
of this lexical function for this argument.  
The paper describes the cases when a 
lexical functional construction in one of 
these languages corresponds to a lexical-
functional construction in the other 
language, but lexical functions 
represented by these two constructions 
are different. The paper lists different 
types of correspondences and gives the 
reasons for their existence. It also shows 
how the information about these 
correspondences can be used to improve 
the work of the linguistic component of 
the machine translation system ETAP-3.
