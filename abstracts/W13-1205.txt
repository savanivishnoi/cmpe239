I present a set of functional requirements for a
speculative tool informing users about events
in historical discourse, in order to demonstrate
what these requirements imply about how we
should define and represent historical events.
The functions include individuation, selection,
and contextualization of events. I conclude
that a tool providing these functions would
need events to be defined and represented as
features of discourses about the world rather
than objectively existing things in the world.
