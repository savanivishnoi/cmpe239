 
As a lexical knowledge base constructed 
automatically from the definitions and 
example sentences in two machine-readable 
dictionaries (MRDs), MindNet embodies 
several features that distinguish it from prior 
work with MRDs. It is, however, more than 
this static resource alone. MindNet represents 
a general methodology for acquiring, 
structuring, accessing, and exploiting semantic 
information from natural language text. This 
paper provides an overview of the 
distinguishing characteristics of MindNet, the 
steps involved in its creation, and its extension 
beyond ictionary text.
