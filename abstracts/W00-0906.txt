 
This article investigates (a) whether register 
discrimination can successfully exploit linguistic 
information reflecting the evolution of a 
language (such as the diglossia phenomenon of
the Modern Greek language) and (b) what kind 
of linguistic information and which statistical 
techniques may be employed to distinguish 
among individual styles within one register. 
Using clustering techniques and features 
reflecting the diglossia phenomenon, we have 
successfully discriminated registers in Modem 
Greek. However, diglossia information has not 
been shown sufficient to distinguish among 
individual styles within one register. Instead, a 
large number of linguistic features need to be 
studied with methods such as discriminant 
analysis in order to obtain a high degree of 
discrimination accuracy.
