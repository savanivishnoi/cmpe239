In this paper we describe the construction of a
new Japanese lexical resource: the Hinoki treebank.
The treebank is built from dictionary definition sen-
tences, and uses an HPSG based Japanese grammar
to encode the syntactic and semantic information.
We show how this treebank can be used to extract
thesaurus information from definition sentences in
a language-neutral way using minimal recursion se-
mantics.
