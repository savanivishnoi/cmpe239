 
We provide a unified account of sentence-level 
and text-level anaphora within the framework of 
a dependency-based grammar model. Criteria for 
anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries 
rephrase major concepts from GB's binding theory, 
while those for text-level anaphora incorporate an 
adapted version of a Grosz-Sidner-style focus model.
