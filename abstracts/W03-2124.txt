A key challenge for users and designers of
spoken language systems is determining
the form of the commands that the system
can recognize. Using more than 60 hours
of interactions, we quantitatively analyze
the acquisition of system vocabulary by
novice users. We contrast the longitudi-
nal performance of long-term novice users
with both expert system developers and
guest users. We find that novice users
successfully learn the form of system re-
quests, achieving a significant decrease in
ill-formed utterances. However, the work-
ing vocabulary on which novice users con-
verge is significantly smaller than that
of expert users, and their rate of speech
recognition errors remains higher. Finally,
we observe that only 50% of each user?s
small vocabulary is shared with any other,
indicating the importance of the flexibility
of a conversational interface that allows
users to converge to their own preferred
vocabulary.
