This paper presents the multi-phase relation
extraction (RE) approach which was used for
the DDI Extraction task of SemEval 2013. As
a preliminary step, the proposed approach in-
directly (and automatically) exploits the scope
of negation cues and the semantic roles of in-
volved entities for reducing the skewness in
the training data as well as discarding possible
negative instances from the test data. Then, a
state-of-the-art hybrid kernel is used to train
a classifier which is later applied on the in-
stances of the test data not filtered out by the
previous step. The official results of the task
show that our approach yields an F-score of
0.80 for DDI detection and an F-score of 0.65
for DDI detection and classification. Our sys-
tem obtained significantly higher results than
all the other participating teams in this shared
task and has been ranked 1st.
