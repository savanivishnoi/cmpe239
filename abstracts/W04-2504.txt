 
In a real-world setting, questions are not 
asked in isolation, but rather in a cohesive 
manner that involves a sequence of related 
questions to meet user?s information needs. 
The capability to interpret and answer 
questions based on context is important. In 
this paper, we discuss the role of discourse 
modeling in context question answering.  In 
particular, we motivate a semantic-rich 
discourse representation and discuss the 
impact of refined discourse structure on 
question answering.
