 
This paper presents an ongoing work on 
identifying similarity between documents 
across News papers in different 
languages. Our aim is to identify similar 
documents for a given News or event as 
a query, across languages and make cross 
lingual search more accurate and easy. 
For example given  an event or News in 
English, all the English news documents 
related to the query are retrieved as well 
as in other languages such as Hindi, 
Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, 
Spanish. We use Vector Space Model, a 
known method for similarity calculation, 
but the novelty is in identification of 
terms for VSM calculation. Here a robust 
translation system is not used for 
translating the documents. The system is 
working with good recall and precision.
