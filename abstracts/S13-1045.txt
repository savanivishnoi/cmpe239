Existing semantic parsing research has
steadily improved accuracy on a few domains
and their corresponding databases. This paper
introduces FreeParser, a system that trains on
one domain and one set of predicate and con-
stant symbols, and then can parse sentences
for any new domain, including sentences that
refer to symbols never seen during training.
FreeParser uses a domain-independent archi-
tecture to automatically identify sentences
relevant to each new database symbol, which
it uses to supplement its manually-annotated
training data from the training domain. In
cross-domain experiments involving 23
domains, FreeParser can parse sentences for
which it has seen comparable unannotated
sentences with an F1 of 0.71.
