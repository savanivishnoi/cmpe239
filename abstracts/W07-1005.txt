We propose an unsupervised method to au-
tomatically extract domain-specific prefixes
and suffixes from biological corpora based
on the use of PATRICIA tree. The method is
evaluated by integrating the extracted affixes
into an existing learning-based biological
term annotation system. The system based
on our method achieves comparable experi-
mental results to the original system in locat-
ing biological terms and exact term match-
ing annotation. However, our method im-
proves the system efficiency by significantly
reducing the feature set size. Additionally,
the method achieves a better performance
with a small training data set. Since the af-
fix extraction process is unsupervised, it is
assumed that the method can be generalized
to extract domain-specific affixes from other
domains, thus assisting in domain-specific
concept recognition.
