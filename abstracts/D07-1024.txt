We introduce a relation extraction method to
identify the sentences in biomedical text that
indicate an interaction among the protein
names mentioned. Our approach is based on
the analysis of the paths between two protein
names in the dependency parse trees of the
sentences. Given two dependency trees, we
define two separate similarity functions (ker-
nels) based on cosine similarity and edit dis-
tance among the paths between the protein
names. Using these similarity functions, we
investigate the performances of two classes
of learning algorithms, Support Vector Ma-
chines and k-nearest-neighbor, and the semi-
supervised counterparts of these algorithms,
transductive SVMs and harmonic functions,
respectively. Significant improvement over
the previous results in the literature is re-
ported as well as a new benchmark dataset
is introduced. Semi-supervised algorithms
perform better than their supervised ver-
sion by a wide margin especially when the
amount of labeled data is limited.
