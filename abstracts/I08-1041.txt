 
Recognizing the emotive meaning of text 
can add another dimension to the under-
standing of text. We study the task of 
automatically categorizing sentences in a 
text into Ekman?s six basic emotion cate-
gories. We experiment with corpus-based 
features as well as features derived from 
two emotion lexicons. One lexicon is 
automatically built using the classification 
system of Roget?s Thesaurus, while the 
other consists of words extracted from 
WordNet-Affect. Experiments on the data 
obtained from blogs show that a combina-
tion of corpus-based unigram features with 
emotion-related features provides superior 
classification performance. We achieve F-
measure values that outperform the rule-
based baseline method for all emotion 
classes.
