This document describes the methods and re-
sults for our participation in the BioNLP?09
Shared Task #1 on Event Extraction. It also
contains some error analysis and a brief dis-
cussion of the results. Previous shared tasks in
the BioNLP community have focused on ex-
tracting gene and protein names, and on find-
ing (direct) protein-protein interactions (PPI).
This year?s task was slightly different, since
the protein names were already manually an-
notated in the text. The new challenge was
to extract biological events involving these
given gene and gene products. We modi-
fied a publicly available system (AkanePPI)
to apply it to this new, but similar, protein
interaction task. AkanePPI has previously
achieved state-of-the-art performance on all
existing public PPI corpora, and only small
changes were needed to achieve competitive
results on this event extraction task. Our of-
ficial result was an F-score of 36.9%, which
was ranked as number six among submissions
from 24 different groups. We later balanced
the recall/precision by including more predic-
tions than just the most confident one in am-
biguous cases, and this raised the F-score on
the test-set to 42.6%. The new Akane program
can be used freely for academic purposes.
