 
ROUGE stands for Recall-Oriented Understudy for 
Gisting Evaluation. It includes measures to auto-
matically determine the quality of a summary by 
comparing it to other (ideal) summaries created by 
humans. The measures count the number of over-
lapping units such as n-gram, word sequences, and 
word pairs between the computer-generated sum-
mary to be evaluated and the ideal summaries cre-
ated by humans. This paper introduces four different 
ROUGE measures: ROUGE-N, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-W, 
and ROUGE-S included in the ROUGE summariza-
tion evaluation package and their evaluations. Three 
of them have been used in the Document Under-
standing Conference (DUC) 2004, a large-scale 
summarization evaluation sponsored by NIST.
