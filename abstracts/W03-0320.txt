A parallel corpus of texts in English and
in Inuktitut, an Inuit language, is presented.
These texts are from the Nunavut Hansards.
The parallel texts are processed in two phases,
the sentence alignment phase and the word cor-
respondence phase. Our sentence alignment
technique achieves a precision of 91.4% and
a recall of 92.3%. Our word correspondence
technique is aimed at providing the broadest
coverage collection of reliable pairs of Inuktitut
and English morphemes for dictionary expan-
sion. For an agglutinative language like Inuk-
titut, this entails considering substrings, not
simply whole words. We employ a Pointwise
Mutual Information method (PMI) and attain a
coverage of 72.3% of English words and a pre-
cision of 87%.
