Chinese sentences are composed with string of 
characters without blanks to mark words. However the 
basic unit for sentence parsing and understanding is 
word. Therefore the first step of processing Chinese 
sentences i to identify the words. The difficulties of 
identifying words include (l) the identification of com- 
plex words, such as Determinative-Measure, redupli- 
cations, derived words etc., (2) the identification of 
proper names,(3) resolving the ambiguous segmenta- 
tions. In this paper, we propose the possible solutions 
for the above difficulties. We adopt a matching algo- 
rithm with 6 different heuristic rules to resolve the am- 
biguities and achieve an 99.77% of the success rate. 
The statistical data supports that the maximal match- 
ing algorithm is the most effective heuristics.
