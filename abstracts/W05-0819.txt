alignment algorithm for English-Hindi 
parallel data. The system was developed 
to participate in the shared task on word 
alignment for languages with scarce 
resources at the ACL 2005 workshop, on 
?Building and using parallel texts: data 
driven machine translation and beyond?.  
Our word alignment algorithm is based on 
a hybrid method which performs local 
word grouping on Hindi sentences and 
uses other methods such as dictionary 
lookup, transliteration similarity, expected 
English words and nearest aligned 
neighbours. We trained our system on the 
training data provided to obtain a list of 
named entities and cognates and to collect 
rules for local word grouping in Hindi 
sentences. The system scored 77.03% 
precision and 60.68% recall on the shared 
task unseen test data.
