Traditionally, domain ontologies are created manually, based on human experts?
views on the classes and relations of the domain at hand. We present ongoing
work on two approaches to the automatic construction of ontologies from a flat
database of records, and compare them to a manually constructed ontology. The
latter CIDOC-CRM ontology focusses on the organisation of classes and relations.
In contrast, the first automatic method, based on machine learning, focuses on the
mutual predictiveness between classes, while the second automatic method, created
with the aid of Wikipedia, stresses meaningful relations between classes. The three
ontologies show little overlap; their differences illustrate that a different focus during
ontology construction can lead to radically different ontologies. We discuss the
implications of these differences, and argue that the two alternative ontologies may
be useful in higher-level information systems such as search engines.
