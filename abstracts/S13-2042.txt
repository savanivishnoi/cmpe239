 
This work introduces a new unsupervised 
approach to multilingual word sense 
disambiguation. Its main purpose is to 
automatically choose the intended sense 
(meaning) of a word in a particular context for 
different languages. It does so by selecting the 
correct Babel synset for the word and the 
various Wiki Page titles that mention the 
word. BabelNet contains all the output 
information that our system needs, in its Babel 
synset. Through Babel synset, we find all the 
possible Synsets for the word in WordNet. 
Using these Synsets, we apply the 
disambiguation method Ppr+Freq to find what 
we need. To facilitate the work with WordNet, 
we use the ISR-WN which offers the 
integration of different resources to WordNet. 
Our system, recognized as the best in the 
competition, obtains results around 69% of 
Recall.
