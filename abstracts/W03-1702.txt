 
We present an unsupervised learning 
strategy for word sense disambiguation 
(WSD) that exploits multiple linguistic 
resources including a parallel corpus, a bi-
lingual machine readable dictionary, and a 
thesaurus. The approach is based on Class 
Based Sense Definition Model (CBSDM) 
that generates the glosses and translations 
for a class of word senses. The model can 
be applied to resolve sense ambiguity for 
words in a parallel corpus. That sense 
tagging procedure, in effect, produces a 
semantic bilingual concordance, which 
can be used to train WSD systems for the 
two languages involved. Experimental re-
sults show that CBSDM trained on 
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary 
English, English-Chinese Edition 
(LDOCE E-C) and Longman Lexicon of 
Contemporary English (LLOCE) is very 
effectively in turning a Chinese-English 
parallel corpus into sense tagged data for 
development of WSD systems.
