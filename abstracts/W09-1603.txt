Most of the Internet data for Indian languages
exist in various encodings, causing difficul-
ties in searching for the information through
search engines. In the Indian scenario, ma-
jority web pages are not searchable or the in-
tended information is not efficiently retrieved
by the search engines due to the following:
(1) Multiple text-encodings are used while
authoring websites. (2) Inspite of Indian
languages sharing common phonetic nature,
common words like loan words (borrowed
from other languages like Sanskrit, Urdu or
English), transliterated terms, pronouns etc.,
can not be searched across languages. (3) Fi-
nally the query input mechanism is another
major problem. Most of the users hardly know
how to type in their native language and pre-
fer to access the information through English
based transliteration. This paper addresses all
these problems and presents a transliteration
based search engine (inSearch) which is ca-
pable of searching 10 multi-script and multi-
encoded Indian languages content on the web.
