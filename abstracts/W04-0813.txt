Our group participated in the Basque and En-
glish lexical sample tasks in Senseval-3. A
language-specific feature set was defined for
Basque. Four different learning algorithms were
applied, and also a method that combined their
outputs. Before submission, the performance
of the methods was tested for each task on the
Senseval-3 training data using cross validation.
Finally, two systems were submitted for each
language: the best single algorithm and the best
ensemble.
