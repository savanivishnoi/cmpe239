Understanding mental states in narratives is an important aspect
of human language comprehension. By ?mental states? we refer to
beliefs, states of knowledge, points of view, and suppositions, all of
which may change over time. In this paper, we propose an approach
for automatically extracting and understanding multiple mental states
in stories. Our model consists of two parts: (1) a parser that takes
an English sentence and translates it to some semantic operations; (2)
a mental-state inference engine that reads in the semantic operations
and produces a situation model that represents the meaning of the
sentence. We present the performance of the system on a corpus of
children stories containing both fictional and non-fictional texts.
