This paper presents a novel type of test, halfway
between multiple-choice and free-form text,
used for training and assessment in several
courses in a Computational Linguistics curricu-
lum. We will describe the principles of the test,
the different ways in which it can be used by
learners, and the tools developed for authoring.
Use of this type of test is not limited to the field
of Computational Linguistics. Wherever text
heavy or even picture based topics are taught
use of this type of test is possible.
