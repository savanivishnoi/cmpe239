There are cultural barriers to collaborative effort
between literary scholars and computational lin-
guists. In this work, we discuss some of these
problems in the context of our ongoing research
project, an exploration of free indirect discourse
in Virginia Woolf?s To The Lighthouse, ulti-
mately arguing that the advantages of taking
each field out of its ?comfort zone? justifies the
inherent difficulties.
