In this paper we study what effects sentiment
have on the temporal dynamics of user inter-
action and content generation in a knowledge
sharing setting. We try to identify how senti-
ment influences interaction dynamics in terms
of answer arrival, user ratings arrival, commu-
nity agreement and content popularity. Our
study suggests that ?Negativity Bias? triggers
more community attention and consequently
more content contribution. Our findings pro-
vide insight into how users interact in online
knowledge sharing communities, and helpful
for improving existing systems.
