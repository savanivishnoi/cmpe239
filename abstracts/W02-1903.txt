  
We propose a fast and reliable 
Question-answering (QA) system in Korean, 
which uses a predictive answer indexer based on 
2-pass scoring method. The indexing process is 
as follows. The predictive answer indexer first 
extracts all answer candidates in a document. 
Then, using 2-pass scoring method, it gives 
scores to the adjacent content words that are 
closely related with each answer candidate. Next, 
it stores the weighted content words with each 
candidate into a database. Using this technique, 
along with a complementary analysis of 
questions, the proposed QA system saves 
response time and enhances the precision.
