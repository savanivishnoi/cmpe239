 
This paper is to introduce a statistical 
method to extract Chinese compound words 
from a very large corpusL This method is 
based on mutual information and context 
dependency. Experimental results show that 
this method is efficient and robust 
compared with other approaches. We also 
examined the impact of different parameter 
settings, corpus size and heterogeneousness 
on the extraction results. We finally present 
results on information retrieval to show the 
usefulness of extracted compounds.
