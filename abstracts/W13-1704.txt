Automated feedback on writing may be a use-
ful complement to teacher comments in the
process of learning a foreign language. This
paper presents a self-assessment and tutoring
system which combines an holistic score with
detection and correction of frequent errors and
furthermore provides a qualitative assessment
of each individual sentence, thus making the
language learner aware of potentially prob-
lematic areas rather than providing a panacea.
The system has been tested by learners in
a range of educational institutions, and their
feedback has guided its development.
