SemFrame generates FrameNet-like
frames, complete with semantic roles and
evoking lexical units. This output can
enhance FrameNet by suggesting new
frames, as well as additional lexical units
that evoke existing frames. SemFrame
output can also support the addition of
frame semantic relationships to WordNet.
