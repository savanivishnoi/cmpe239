The goal of semantic dependency parsing is to
build dependency structure and label seman-
tic relation between a head and its modifier.
To attain this goal, we concentrate on obtain-
ing better dependency structure to predict bet-
ter semantic relations, and propose a method
to combine the results of three state-of-the-art
dependency parsers. Unfortunately, we made
a mistake when we generate the final output
that results in a lower score of 56.31% in term
of Labeled Attachment Score (LAS), reported
by organizers. After giving golden testing set,
we fix the bug and rerun the evaluation script,
this time we obtain the score of 62.8% which
is consistent with the results on developing set.
We will report detailed experimental results
with correct program as a comparison stan-
dard for further research.
