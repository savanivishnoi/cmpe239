Amharic  is  the  Semitic  language  that  has  the 
second  large  number  of  speakers  after  Arabic 
(Hayward and Richard 1999). Its writing system is 
syllabic  with  Consonant-Vowel  (CV)  syllable 
structure. Amharic orthography has more or less a 
one  to  one correspondence with  syllabic  sounds. 
We have used this feature of Amharic to develop a 
CV syllable-based speech recognizer,  using  Hid-
den  Markov  Modeling  (HMM),  and  achieved 
90.43% word recognition accuracy.
