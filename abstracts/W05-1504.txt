In lexicalized phrase-structure or dependency parses, a word?s
modifiers tend to fall near it in the string. We show that a crude
way to use dependency length as a parsing feature can sub-
stantially improve parsing speed and accuracy in English and
Chinese, with more mixed results on German. We then show
similar improvements by imposing hard bounds on dependency
length and (additionally) modeling the resulting sequence of
parse fragments. This simple ?vine grammar? formalism has
only finite-state power, but a context-free parameterization with
some extra parameters for stringing fragments together. We ex-
hibit a linear-time chart parsing algorithm with a low grammar
constant.
