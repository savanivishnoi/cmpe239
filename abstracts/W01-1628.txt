In this paper we show that interruptions are
important elements in the interactive character
of discourse and in the resolution of issues of
cognitive uncertainty and planning. By
representing discourse graphically, we also
show that interruptions are part of the local and
global coherence that is brought about through
the systematic phrase-to-phrase prosodic
patterns of discourse. The specific pitch height
of the interruption varies with the expression of
emotion, signals of attention-getting, and signals
of competitiveness. These prosodic forms are
potentially usable in spoken dialogue systems to
provide intelligent responding systems that are
responsive to human motivations in dialogues.
