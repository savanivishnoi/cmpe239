We propose a data-driven method for au-
tomatically analyzing the morphology of
ancient Greek. This method improves on
existing ancient Greek analyzers in two
ways. First, through the use of a nearest-
neighbor machine learning framework, the
analyzer requires no hand-crafted rules.
Second, it is able to predict novel roots,
and to rerank its predictions by exploiting a
large, unlabelled corpus of ancient Greek.
