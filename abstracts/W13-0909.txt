We employ robust, quantitative language processing to implement a system prototype combined with sound social science methods for validation. We show results in 4 different languages and discuss how our methods are a significant step forward from previously established techniques of metaphor identification. We use Topical Structure and Tracking, an Imageability score, and innova-tive methods to build an effective metaphor identification system that is fully automated and performs well over baseline.  1
