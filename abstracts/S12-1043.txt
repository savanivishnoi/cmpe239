In this paper, we present a system for de-
tecting negation in English text. We address
three tasks: negation cue detection, negation
scope resolution and negated event identifi-
cation. We pose these tasks as sequence la-
beling problems. For each task, we train a
Conditional Random Field (CRF) model on
lexical, structural, and syntactic features ex-
tracted from labeled data. The models are
trained and tested using the dataset distributed
with the *sem Shared Task 2012 on resolving
the scope and focus of negation. The system
detects negation cues with 90.98% F1 mea-
sure (94.3% and 87.88% recall). It identifies
negation scope with 82.70% F1 on token-by-
token level and 64.78% F1 on full scope level.
Negated events are detected with 51.10% F1
measure.
