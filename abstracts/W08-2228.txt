We aim to address two complementary deficiencies in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) research: (i) Despite the importance and prevalence of
metaphor across many discourse genres, and metaphor?s many functions,
applied NLP has mostly not addressed metaphor understanding. But,
conversely, (ii) difficult issues in metaphor understanding have hindered
large-scale application, extensive empirical evaluation, and the handling
of the true breadth of metaphor types and interactions with other language
phenomena. In this paper, abstracted from a recent grant proposal, a new
avenue for addressing both deficiencies and for inspiring new basic re-
search on metaphor is investigated: namely, placing metaphor research
within the ?Recognizing Textual Entailment? (RTE) task framework for
evaluation of semantic processing systems.
