This paper presents a deterministic dependency
parser based on memory-based learning, which
parses English text in linear time. When trained
and evaluated on the Wall Street Journal sec-
tion of the Penn Treebank, the parser achieves
a maximum attachment score of 87.1%. Unlike
most previous systems, the parser produces la-
beled dependency graphs, using as arc labels a
combination of bracket labels and grammatical
role labels taken from the Penn Treebank II an-
notation scheme. The best overall accuracy ob-
tained for identifying both the correct head and
the correct arc label is 86.0%, when restricted
to grammatical role labels (7 labels), and 84.4%
for the maximum set (50 labels).
