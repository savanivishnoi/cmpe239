This paper complements a series of works on
implicative verbs such as manage to and fail
to. It extends the description of simple im-
plicative verbs to phrasal implicatives as take
the time to and waste the chance to. It shows
that the implicative signatures of over 300
verb-noun collocations depend both on the se-
mantic type of the verb and the semantic type
of the noun in a systematic way.
