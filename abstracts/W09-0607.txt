Georeferenced data sets are often large and
complex. Natural Language Generation
(NLG) systems are beginning to emerge that
generate texts from such data. One of the
challenges these systems face is the gener-
ation of geographic descriptions referring to
the location of events or patterns in the data.
Based on our studies in the domain of me-
teorology we present a two staged approach
to generating geographic descriptions. The
first stage involves using domain knowledge
based on the task context to select a frame
of reference, and the second involves using
constraints imposed by the end user to select
values within a frame of reference. Because
geographic concepts are inherently vague our
approach does not guarantee a distinguish-
ing description. Our evaluation studies show
that NLG systems, because they can analyse
input data exhaustively, can produce more
fine-grained geographic descriptions that are
more useful to end users than those generated
by human experts.
