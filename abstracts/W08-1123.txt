We describe the creation of a new domain for
the Methodius Natural Language Generation
System, and an evaluation of Methodius? pa-
rameterized comparison generation algorithm.
The new domain was based around music and
performers, and texts about the domain were
generated using Methodius. Our evaluation
showed that test subjects learned more from
texts that contained comparisons than from
those that did not. We also established that the
comparison generation algorithm could gener-
alize to the music domain.
