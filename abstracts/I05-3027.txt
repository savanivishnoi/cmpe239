We present a Chinese word seg-
mentation system submitted to the 
closed track of Sighan bakeoff 2005. 
Our segmenter was built using a condi-
tional random field sequence model 
that provides a framework to use a 
large number of linguistic features such 
as character identity, morphological 
and character reduplication features. 
Because our morphological features 
were extracted from the training cor-
pora automatically, our system was not 
biased toward any particular variety of 
Mandarin. Thus, our system does not 
overfit the variety of Mandarin most 
familiar to the system's designers. Our 
final system achieved a F-score of 
0.947 (AS), 0.943 (HK), 0.950 (PK) 
and 0.964 (MSR).
