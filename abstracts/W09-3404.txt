 
In this paper, two corpora of Urdu (with 110K 
and 120K words) tagged with different POS 
tagsets are used to train TnT and Tree taggers. 
Error analysis of both taggers is done to identi-
fy frequent confusions in tagging. Based on 
the analysis of tagging, and syntactic structure 
of Urdu, a more refined tagset is derived.  The 
existing tagged corpora are tagged with the 
new tagset to develop a single corpus of 230K 
words and the TnT tagger is retrained.  The re-
sults show improvement in tagging accuracy 
for individual corpora to 94.2% and also for 
the merged corpus to 91%.  Implications of 
these results are discussed.
