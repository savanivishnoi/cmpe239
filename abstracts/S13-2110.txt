 
We describe our system for the DDIExtraction-2013 shared task of classifying Drug-Drug interactions (DDIs) given labeled drug mentions. The challenge called for a five-way classification of all drug pairs in each sentence: a drug pair is either non-interacting, or interacting as one of four types. Our approach begins with the use of a two-stage weighted SVM classifier to handle the highly unbalanced class distribution: the first stage for a binary classification of drug pairs as interacting or non-interacting, and the second stage for further classification of interacting pairs from the first stage into one of the four interacting types. Our SVM features exploit stemmed words, lemmas, bigrams, part of speech tags, verb lists, and similarity measures, among others. For each stage, we also developed a set of post-processing rules based on observations in the training data. Our best system achieved 0.472 F-measure.  1
