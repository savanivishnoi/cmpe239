We created a dataset of syntactic-ngrams
(counted dependency-tree fragments) based
on a corpus of 3.5 million English books. The
dataset includes over 10 billion distinct items
covering a wide range of syntactic configura-
tions. It also includes temporal information,
facilitating new kinds of research into lexical
semantics over time. This paper describes the
dataset, the syntactic representation, and the
kinds of information provided.
