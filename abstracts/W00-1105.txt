 
In spite of long controversy, effectiveness of 
phrasal indexing is not yet clear. 
Recently, correlation between query length and 
effect of phrasal indexing is reported. 
In this paper, terms extracted from the topic set 
of the NACSIS test collection 1are analyzed 
utilizing statistic tools in order to show 
distribution characteristics of single 
word/phrasal terms with regard to relevant/non- 
relevant documents. Phrasal terms are found to 
be very good discriminators in general but not 
all of them are effective as supplemental phrasal 
terms. A distinction of informative / neutral / 
destructive phrasal terms is introduced. Retrieval 
effectiveness is examined utilizing query weight 
ratio of these three categories of phrasal terms.
