 
This paper proposes a dependency tree-
based SRL system with proper pruning and 
extensive feature engineering. Official 
evaluation on the CoNLL 2008 shared task 
shows that our system achieves 76.19 in la-
beled macro F1 for the overall task, 84.56 
in labeled attachment score for syntactic 
dependencies, and 67.12 in labeled F1 for 
semantic dependencies on combined test 
set, using the standalone MaltParser. Be-
sides, this paper also presents our unofficial 
system by 1) applying a new effective 
pruning algorithm; 2) including additional 
features; and 3) adopting a better depend-
ency parser, MSTParser. Unofficial evalua-
tion on the shared task shows that our sys-
tem achieves 82.53 in labeled macro F1, 
86.39 in labeled attachment score, and 
78.64 in labeled F1, using MSTParser on 
combined test set. This suggests that proper 
pruning and extensive feature engineering 
contributes much in dependency tree-based 
SRL.
