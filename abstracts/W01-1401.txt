 
We propose a new approach under the 
example-based machine translation 
paradigm. First, the proposed approach 
retrieves the most similar example by 
carrying out DP-matching of the input 
sentence and example sentences while 
measuring the semantic distance of the 
words. Second, the approach adjusts 
the gap between the input and the most 
similar example by using a bilingual 
dictionary. We show the results of a 
computational experiment.
