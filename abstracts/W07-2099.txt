We describe two systems participating of the
English Lexical Sample task in SemEval-
2007. The systems make use of Inductive
Logic Programming for supervised learning
in two different ways: (a) to build Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) models from
a rich set of background knowledge sources;
and (b) to build interesting features from
the same knowledge sources, which are then
used by a standard model-builder for WSD,
namely, Support Vector Machines. Both sys-
tems achieved comparable accuracy (0.851
and 0.857), which outperforms considerably
the most frequent sense baseline (0.787).
