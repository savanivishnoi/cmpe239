This paper describes our submission for the
*SEM shared task of Semantic Textual Sim-
ilarity. We estimate the semantic similarity
between two sentences using regression mod-
els with features: 1) n-gram hit rates (lexical
matches) between sentences, 2) lexical seman-
tic similarity between non-matching words, 3)
string similarity metrics, 4) affective content
similarity and 5) sentence length. Domain
adaptation is applied in the form of indepen-
dent models and a model selection strategy
achieving a mean correlation of 0.47.
