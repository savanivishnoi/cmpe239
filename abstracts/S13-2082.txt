 
We propose a method for using discourse rela-
tions for polarity detection of tweets. We have 
focused on unstructured and noisy text like 
tweets on which linguistic tools like parsers and 
POS-taggers don?t work properly. We have 
showed how conjunctions, connectives, modals 
and conditionals affect the sentiments in tweets. 
We have also handled the commonly used ab-
breviations, slangs and collocations which are 
usually used in short text messages like tweets. 
This work focuses on a Web based application 
which produces results in real time. This ap-
proach is an extension of the previous work 
(Mukherjee et al 2012).
