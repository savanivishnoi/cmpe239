 
In this paper, we present a machine learning 
approach that detects hedge cues and their 
scope in biomedical texts. Identifying hedged 
information in texts is a kind of semantic 
filtering of texts and it is important since it 
could extract speculative information from 
factual information. In order to deal with the 
semantic analysis problem, various evidential 
features are proposed and integrated through a 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model. 
Hedge cues that appear in the training dataset 
are regarded as keywords and employed as an 
important feature in hedge cue identification 
system. For the scope finding, we construct a 
CRF-based system and a syntactic 
pattern-based system, and compare their 
performances. Experiments using test data 
from CoNLL-2010 shared task show that our 
proposed method is robust. F-score of the 
biological hedge detection task and scope 
finding task achieves 86.32% and 54.18% in 
in-domain evaluations respectively.
