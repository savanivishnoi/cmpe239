 
We present several statistical models of syntactic 
constituent order for sentence realization. We 
compare several models, including simple joint 
models inspired by existing statistical parsing 
models, and several novel conditional models. The 
conditional models leverage a large set of linguistic 
features without manual feature selection. We apply 
and evaluate the models in sentence realization for 
French and German and find that a particular 
conditional model outperforms all others. We 
employ a version of that model in an evaluation on 
unordered trees from the Penn TreeBank. We offer 
this result on standard data as a reference-point for 
evaluations of ordering in sentence realization.
