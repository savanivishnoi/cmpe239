 
Many recent annotation efforts for English 
have focused on pieces of the larger problem 
of semantic annotation, rather than initially 
producing a single unified representation. 
This paper discusses the issues involved in 
merging four of these efforts into a unified 
linguistic structure: PropBank, NomBank, the 
Discourse Treebank and Coreference 
Annotation undertaken at the University of 
Essex. We discuss resolving overlapping and 
conflicting annotation as well as how the 
various annotation schemes can reinforce 
each other to produce a representation that is 
greater than the sum of its parts.
