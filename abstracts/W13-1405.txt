 
This position paper argues the need for a 
comprehensive corpus of online book re-
sponses. Responses to books (in traditional 
reviews, book blogs, on booksellers? sites, 
etc.) are important for understanding how 
readers understand literature and how literary 
works become popular. A sufficiently large, 
varied and representative corpus of online re-
sponses to books will facilitate research into 
these processes. This corpus should include 
context information about the responses and 
should remain open to additional material. 
Based on a pilot study for the creation of a 
corpus of Dutch online book response, the 
paper shows how linguistic tools can find 
differences in word usage between responses 
from various sites. They can also reveal re-
sponse type by clustering responses based on 
usage of either words or their POS-tags, and 
can show the sentiments expressed in the re-
sponses. LSA-based similarity between book 
fragments and response may be able to reveal 
the book fragments that most affected read-
ers. The paper argues that a corpus of book 
responses can be an important instrument for 
research into reading behavior, reader re-
sponse, book reviewing and literary appre-
ciation.
