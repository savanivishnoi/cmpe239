We address the problem of translating from
morphologically poor to morphologically rich
languages by adding per-word linguistic in-
formation to the source language. We use
the syntax of the source sentence to extract
information for noun cases and verb persons
and annotate the corresponding words accord-
ingly. In experiments, we show improved
performance for translating from English into
Greek and Czech. For English?Greek, we re-
duce the error on the verb conjugation from
19% to 5.4% and noun case agreement from
9% to 6%.
