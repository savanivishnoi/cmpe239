In this paper we describe the English Lexical
Substitution task for SemEval. In the task,
annotators and systems find an alternative
substitute word or phrase for a target word in
context. The task involves both finding the
synonyms and disambiguating the context.
Participating systems are free to use any lex-
ical resource. There is a subtask which re-
quires identifying cases where the word is
functioning as part of a multiword in the sen-
tence and detecting what that multiword is.
