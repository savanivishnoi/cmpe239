 
The paper introduces the ways in which 
methods and resources of natural language 
processing (NLP) can be fruitfully employed 
in the domain of information assurance and 
security (IAS). IAS may soon claim a very 
prominent status both conceptually and in 
terms of future funding for NLP, alongside 
or even instead of established applications, 
such as machine translation (MT). After a 
brief summary of theoretical premises of 
NLP in general and of ontological semantics 
as a specific approach to NLP developed 
and/or practiced by the authors, the paper 
reports on the interaction between NLP and 
IAS through brief discussions of some 
implemented and planned NLP-enhanced 
IAS systems at the Center for Education and 
Research in Information Assurance and 
Security (CERIAS). The rest of the paper 
deals with the milestones and challenges in 
the future interaction between NLP and IAS 
as well as the role of a representational, 
meaning-based NLP approach in that future.
