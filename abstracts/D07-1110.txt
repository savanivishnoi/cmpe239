This paper focuses on the evaluation of meth-
ods for the automatic acquisition of Multiword
Expressions (MWEs) for robust grammar engi-
neering. First we investigate the hypothesis that
MWEs can be detected by the distinct statistical
properties of their component words, regardless
of their type, comparing 3 statistical measures:
mutual information (MI), ?2 and permutation
entropy (PE). Our overall conclusion is that at
least two measures, MI and PE, seem to differen-
tiate MWEs from non-MWEs. We then investi-
gate the influence of the size and quality of differ-
ent corpora, using the BNC and the Web search
engines Google and Yahoo. We conclude that, in
terms of language usage, web generated corpora
are fairly similar to more carefully built corpora,
like the BNC, indicating that the lack of con-
trol and balance of these corpora are probably
compensated by their size. Finally, we show a
qualitative evaluation of the results of automat-
ically adding extracted MWEs to existing lin-
guistic resources. We argue that such a process
improves qualitatively, if a more compositional
approach to grammar/lexicon automated exten-
sion is adopted.
