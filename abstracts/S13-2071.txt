The paper describes experiments using grid
searches over various combinations of ma-
chine learning algorithms, features and pre-
processing strategies in order to produce the
optimal systems for sentiment classification of
microblog messages. The approach is fairly
domain independent, as demonstrated by the
systems achieving quite competitive results
when applied to short text message data, i.e.,
input they were not originally trained on.
