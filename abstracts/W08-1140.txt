 
This document describes the development of a 
surface realisation component for the Portu-
guese language that takes advantage of the 
data and evaluation tools provided by the 
REG-2008 team. At this initial stage, our 
work uses simple n-gram statistics to produce 
descriptions in the Furniture domain, with lit-
tle or no linguistic variation. Preliminary re-
sults suggest that, unlike the generation of 
English descriptions, contextual information 
may be required to account for Portuguese 
word order.
