We report on an attempt to extend a reference
generation system, originally designed only
for main subjects, to generate references for
multiple entities in a single document. This
endeavor yielded three separate systems: one
utilizing the original classifier, another with a
retrained classifier, and a third taking advan-
tage of new data to improve the identification
of interfering antecedents. Each subsequent
system improved upon the results of the pre-
vious iteration.
