 
We present an unsupervised and unrestricted 
approach to discovering an infobox like on-
tology by exploiting the inter-article links 
within Wikipedia. It discovers new slots and 
fillers that may not be available in the 
Wikipedia infoboxes. Our results demonstrate 
that there are certain types of properties that 
are evident in the link structure of resources 
like Wikipedia that can be predicted with high 
accuracy using little or no linguistic analysis. 
The discovered properties can be further used 
to discover a class hierarchy. Our experiments 
have focused on analyzing people in Wikipe-
dia, but the techniques can be directly applied 
to other types of entities in text resources that 
are rich with hyperlinks.
