This paper describes the phrase-based SMT
systems developed for our participation
in the WMT11 Shared Translation Task.
Translations for English?German and
English?French were generated using a
phrase-based translation system which is
extended by additional models such as
bilingual and fine-grained POS language
models, POS-based reordering, lattice phrase
extraction and discriminative word alignment.
Furthermore, we present a special filtering
method for the English-French Giga corpus
and the phrase scoring step in the training is
parallelized.
