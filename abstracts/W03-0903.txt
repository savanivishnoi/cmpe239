The approach to knowledge representation
taken in a multi-modal multi-domain dialogue
system - SMARTKOM - is presented. We fo-
cus on the ontological and representational is-
sues and choices helping to construct an ontol-
ogy, which is shared by multiple components of
the system, can be re-used in different projects
and applied to various tasks. Finally, examples
highlighting the usefulness of our approach are
given.
