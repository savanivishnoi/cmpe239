 
Although vast amounts of textual data are freely 
available, many NLP algorithms exploit only a 
minute percentage of it. In this paper, we study the 
challenges of working at the terascale. We present 
an algorithm, designed for the terascale, for mining  
is-a relations that achieves similar performance to a 
state-of-the-art linguistically-rich method. We fo-
cus on the accuracy of these two systems as a func-
tion of processing time and corpus size.
