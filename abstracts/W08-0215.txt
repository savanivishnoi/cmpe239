 
Computational modeling of human language 
processes is a small but growing subfield of 
computational linguistics. This paper 
describes a course that makes use of recent 
research in psychocomputational modeling as 
a framework to introduce a number of 
mainstream computational linguistics 
concepts to an audience of linguistics, 
cognitive science and computer science 
doctoral students. The emphasis on what I 
take to be the largely interdisciplinary nature 
of computational linguistics is particularly 
germane for the computer science students. 
Since 2002 the course has been taught three 
times under the auspices of the MA/PhD 
program in Linguistics at The City University 
of New York?s Graduate Center. A brief 
description of some of the students? 
experiences after having taken the course is 
also provided.
