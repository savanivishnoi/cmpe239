  
To be unambiguous about a Chinese 
geographic name represented in English text 
as Pinyin, one needs to recover the name in 
Chinese characters. We present our approach 
to this back-transliteration problem based on 
processes such as bilingual geographic name 
lookup, name suggestion using place name 
character and pair frequencies, and 
confirmation via a collection of monolingual 
names or the WWW. Evaluation shows that 
about 48% to 72% of the correct names can 
be recovered as the top candidate, and 82% to 
86% within top ten, depending on the 
processes employed.
