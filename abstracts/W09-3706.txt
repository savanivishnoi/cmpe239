This paper presents a new perspective on the use of semantic an-
notations. We argue that semantic annotations should (1) capture
semantic information that is complimentary to the information that is
expressed in the source text; (2) have a formal interpretation. If these
conditions are fullfilled, then the information in semantic annotations
can be effectively combined with the information in the source text
by interpreting a semantic annotation language through the transla-
tion of annotations into the same formalism as underspecified semantic
representations obtained through compositional semantic analysis.
