One of the particular characteristics
of text classification tasks is that they
present large class imbalances. Such a
problem can easily be tackled using re-
sampling methods. However, although
these approaches are very simple to im-
plement, tuning them most effectively
is not an easy task. In particular,
it is unclear whether oversampling is
more effective than undersampling and
which oversampling or undersampling
rate should be used. This paper presents
a method for combining different ex-
pressions of the re-sampling approach
in a mixture of experts framework. The
proposed combination scheme is evalu-
ated on a very imbalanced subset of the
REUTERS-21578 text collection and is
shown to be very effective on this do-
main.
