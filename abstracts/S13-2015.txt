In this paper, we present a system, UTTime,
which we submitted to TempEval-3 for Task
C: Annotating temporal relations. The sys-
tem uses logistic regression classifiers and ex-
ploits features extracted from a deep syntactic
parser, including paths between event words in
phrase structure trees and their path lengths,
and paths between event words in predicate-
argument structures and their subgraphs. UT-
Time achieved an F1 score of 34.9 based
on the graphed-based evaluation for Task C
(ranked 2nd) and 56.45 for Task C-relation-
only (ranked 1st) in the TempEval-3 evalua-
tion.
