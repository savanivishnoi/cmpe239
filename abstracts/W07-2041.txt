 
In this paper we describe a person clus-
tering system for web pages and report 
the results we have obtained on the test 
set of the Semeval 2007 Web Person 
Search task. Deciding which particular 
person a name refers to within a text 
document depends mainly on the capac-
ity to extract the relevant information 
out of texts when it is present. We con-
sider ?relevant? here to stand primarily 
for two properties: (1) uniqueness and 
(2) appropriateness. In order to address 
both (1) and (2) our method gives pri-
mary importance to Name Entities 
(NEs), defined according to the ACE 
specifications. The common nouns not 
referring to entities are considered fur-
ther as coreference clues only if they are 
found within already coreferred docu-
ments.
