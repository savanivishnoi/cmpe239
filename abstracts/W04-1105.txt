 
This paper will present an enhanced 
probabilistic model for Chinese word 
segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) 
tagging. The model introduces the information 
of Chinese word length as one of its features 
to reach a more accurate result. And in 
addition, the model also achieves the 
integration of segmentation and POS tagging. 
After presenting the model, this paper will 
give a brief discussion on how to solve the 
problems in statistics and how to further 
integrate Chinese Named Entity Recognition 
into the model. Finally, some figures of 
experiments and comparisons will be reported, 
which shows that the accuracy of word 
segmentation is 97.09%, and the accuracy of 
POS tagging is 98.77%.
