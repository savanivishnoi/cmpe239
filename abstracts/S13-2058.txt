Named entity recognition (NER) systems
are often based on machine learning tech-
niques to reduce the labor-intensive devel-
opment of hand-crafted extraction rules and
domain-dependent dictionaries. Nevertheless,
time-consuming feature engineering is often
needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
In this study, we investigate the impact of such
domain-specific features on the performance
of recognizing and classifying mentions of
pharmacological substances. We compare the
performance of a system based on general fea-
tures, which have been successfully applied
to a wide range of NER tasks, with a system
that additionally uses features generated from
the output of an existing chemical NER tool
and a collection of domain-specific resources.
We demonstrate that acceptable results can be
achieved with the former system. Still, our ex-
periments show that using domain-specific fea-
tures outperforms this general approach. Our
system ranked first in the SemEval-2013 Task
9.1: Recognition and classification of pharma-
cological substances.
