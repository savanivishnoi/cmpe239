This document outlines minimal design 
principles underlying annotation of 
coreference relations in PoCoS, a scheme 
for cross-linguistic anaphoric annotation. 
We identify language-independent princi-
ples for markable identification which are 
essential for comparability of annotations 
produced for different languages. We fur-
ther suggest a clear and motivated structure 
of annotation stages, the separation of a 
coarse-grained core and a family of more 
elaborate extended schemes, and strategies 
for the systematic treatment of ambiguity. 
Explicit mark-up of ambiguities is a novel 
feature. We implemented three instantia-
tions of PoCoS for German, English and 
Russian applied to corpora of newspaper 
texts.
