Though dynamic programming matching
can carry out approximate string matching
when there may be deletions or insertions
in a document, its effectiveness and
efficiency are usually too poor to use it for
large-scale information retrieval. In this
paper, we propose a method of dynamic
programming matching for information
retrieval. This method is as effective as a
conventional information retrieval system,
even though it is capable of approximate
matching. It is also as efficient as a
conventional system.
