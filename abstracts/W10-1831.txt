We describe the challenges of resource
creation for a resource-light system for
morphological tagging of fusional lan-
guages (Feldman and Hana, 2010). The
constraints on resources (time, expertise,
and money) introduce challenges that are
not present in development of morphologi-
cal tools and corpora in the usual, resource
intensive way.
