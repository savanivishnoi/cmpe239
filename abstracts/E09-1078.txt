We present and evaluate a new model for
Natural Language Generation (NLG) in
Spoken Dialogue Systems, based on statis-
tical planning, given noisy feedback from
the current generation context (e.g. a user
and a surface realiser). We study its use in
a standard NLG problem: how to present
information (in this case a set of search re-
sults) to users, given the complex trade-
offs between utterance length, amount of
information conveyed, and cognitive load.
We set these trade-offs by analysing exist-
ing MATCH data. We then train a NLG pol-
icy using Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which adapts its behaviour to noisy feed-
back from the current generation context.
This policy is compared to several base-
lines derived from previous work in this
area. The learned policy significantly out-
performs all the prior approaches.
