 
Linguistically annotated corpus based 
on texts in biomedical domain has been 
constructed to tune natural language 
processing (NLP) tools for bio-
textmining. As the focus of information 
extraction is shifting from "nominal" 
information such as named entity to 
"verbal" information such as function 
and interaction of substances, applica-
tion of parsers has become one of the 
key technologies and thus the corpus 
annotated for syntactic structure of sen-
tences is in demand. A subset of the 
GENIA corpus consisting of 500 
MEDLINE abstracts has been anno-
tated for syntactic structure in an XML-
based format based on Penn Treebank 
II (PTB) scheme. Inter-annotator 
agreement test indicated that the writ-
ing style rather than the contents of the 
research abstracts is the source of the 
difficulty in tree annotation, and that 
annotation can be stably done by lin-
guists without much knowledge of bi-
ology with appropriate guidelines 
regarding to linguistic phenomena par-
ticular to scientific texts.
