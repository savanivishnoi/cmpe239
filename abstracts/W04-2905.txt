In this paper we highlight the problems that
arise due to variations of spellings of names
that occur in text, as a result of which links be-
tween two pieces of text where the same name
is spelt differently may be missed. The problem
is particularly pronounced in the case of ASR
text. We propose the use of approximate string
matching techniques to normalize names in or-
der to overcome the problem. We show how we
could achieve an improvement if we could tag
names with reasonable accuracy in ASR.
