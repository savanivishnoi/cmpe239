We describe two systems that participated
in SemEval-2010 task 17 (All-words Word
Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Do-
main) and were ranked in the third and
fourth positions in the formal evaluation.
Domain adaptation techniques using the
background documents released in the
task were used to assign ranking scores to
the words and their senses. The test data
was disambiguated using the Personalized
PageRank algorithm which was applied
to a graph constructed from the whole of
WordNet in which nodes are initialized
with ranking scores of words and their
senses. In the competition, our systems
achieved comparable accuracy of 53.4 and
52.2, which outperforms the most frequent
sense baseline (50.5).
