 
This paper describes an innovative 
evaluation regimen developed for the text 
meaning representations (TMRs) produced 
by the Ontological Semantic (OntoSem) 
general purpose syntactic-semantic 
analyzer. The goal of evaluation is not only 
to determine the quality of TMRs for given 
texts, but also to assign blame for various 
classes of errors, thus suggesting directions 
for continued work on both knowledge 
resources and processors. The paper 
includes descriptions of the OntoSem 
processing environment, the evaluation 
regime itself and results from ur first 
evaluation effort.
