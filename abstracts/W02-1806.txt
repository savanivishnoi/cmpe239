 
The Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar 
(PCFG) model is widely used for parsing 
natural languages, including Modern 
Chinese. But for Classical Chinese, the 
computer processing is just commencing. 
Our previous study on the part-of-speech 
(POS) tagging of Classical Chinese is a 
pioneering work in this area. Now in this 
paper, we move on to the PCFG parsing of 
Classical Chinese texts. We continue to 
use the same tagset and corpus as our 
previous study, and apply the 
bigram-based forward-backward algorithm 
to obtain the context-dependent 
probabilities. Then for the PCFG model, 
we restrict the rewriting rules to be 
binary/unary rules, which will simplify our 
programming. A small-sized rule-set was 
developed that could account for the 
grammatical phenomena occurred in the 
corpus. The restriction of texts lies in the 
limitation on the amount of proper nouns 
and difficult characters.  In our 
preliminary experiments, the parser gives 
a promising accuracy of 82.3%.
