 
This paper presents a fuzzy set theory 
based approach to Chinese sentence-level 
sentiment classification. Compared with 
traditional topic-based text classification 
techniques, the fuzzy set theory provides 
a straightforward way to model the 
intrinsic fuzziness between sentiment 
polarity classes. To approach fuzzy 
sentiment classification, we first propose 
a fine-to-coarse strategy to estimate 
sentence sentiment intensity. Then, we 
define three fuzzy sets to represent the 
respective sentiment polarity classes, 
namely positive, negative and neutral 
sentiments. Based on sentence sentiment 
intensities, we further build membership 
functions to indicate the degrees of an 
opinionated sentence in different fuzzy 
sets. Finally, we determine sentence-level 
polarity under maximum membership 
principle. We show that our approach can 
achieve promising performance on the 
test set for Chinese opinion analysis pilot 
task at NTCIR-6.
