 
In this paper we propose a method that 
uses corpora where phrases are annotated 
as Positive, Negative, Objective and 
Neutral, to achieve new sentiment 
resources involving words dictionaries 
with their associated polarity. Our 
method was created to build sentiment 
words inventories based on senti-
semantic evidences obtained after 
exploring text with annotated sentiment 
polarity information. Through this 
process a graph-based algorithm is used 
to obtain auto-balanced values that 
characterize sentiment polarities well 
used on Sentiment Analysis tasks. To 
assessment effectiveness of the obtained 
resource, sentiment classification was 
made, achieving objective instances over 
80%.
