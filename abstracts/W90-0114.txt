 
While a coherent organization is necessary for the genera- 
tion of a multisentential paragraph, this organization itself 
conveys information, such as what knowledge is primary 
and what is secondary, and which of the various possible 
relationships between the pieces of knowledge the speaker 
wishes to make explicit. The organization of the message 
is an integral part of the message. Given this, it is wrong to 
assign the task of text structuring to any component other 
than the one that desires to convey the message in the first 
place. This paper describes George, a proposed system 
that organizes its text before the task of generation is be- 
gun. Particular attention is given to a new knowledge base 
paradigm called functional hierarchy, which is designed to 
facilitate xplanation generation, and how it can be used 
to build Rhetorical Structure Theory representations that 
specify text organization before actual generation is begun.
