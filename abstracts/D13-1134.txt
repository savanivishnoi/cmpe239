We present a statistical model for predicting
how the user of an interactive, situated NLP
system resolved a referring expression. The
model makes an initial prediction based on the
meaning of the utterance, and revises it con-
tinuously based on the user?s behavior. The
combined model outperforms its components
in predicting reference resolution and when to
give feedback.
