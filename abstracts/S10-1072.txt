recognition and normalization of temporal 
expressions (Task 13: TempEval-2, Task 
A). The recognition task is approached as 
a classification problem of sentence con-
stituents and the normalization is imple-
mented in a rule-based manner. One of the 
system features is extending positive an-
notations in the corpus by semantically 
similar words automatically obtained from 
a large unannotated textual corpus. The 
best results obtained by the system are 
0.85 and 0.84 for precision and recall re-
spectively for recognition of temporal ex-
pressions; the accuracy values of 0.91 and 
0.55 were obtained for the feature values 
TYPE and VAL respectively.
