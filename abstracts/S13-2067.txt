This paper briefly reports our submissions
to the two subtasks of Semantic Analysis in
Twitter task in SemEval 2013 (Task 2), i.e.,
the Contextual Polarity Disambiguation task
(an expression-level task) and the Message
Polarity Classification task (a message-level
task). We extract features from surface infor-
mation of tweets, i.e., content features, Micro-
blogging features, emoticons, punctuation and
sentiment lexicon, and adopt SVM to build
classifier. For subtask A, our system on twit-
ter data ranks 2 on unconstrained rank and on
SMS data ranks 1 on unconstrained rank.
