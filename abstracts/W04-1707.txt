 
We consider in depth the semantic analysis in 
learning systems as well as some information 
retrieval techniques applied for measuring the 
document similarity in eLearning. These 
results are obtained in a CALL project, which 
ended by extensive user evaluation. After 
several years spent in the development of 
CALL modules and prototypes, we think that 
much closer cooperation with real teaching 
experts is necessary, to find the proper 
learning niches and suitable wrappings of the 
language technologies, which could give birth 
to useful eLearning solutions.
