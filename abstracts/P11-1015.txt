Unsupervised vector-based approaches to se-
mantics can model rich lexical meanings, but
they largely fail to capture sentiment informa-
tion that is central to many word meanings and
important for a wide range of NLP tasks. We
present a model that uses a mix of unsuper-
vised and supervised techniques to learn word
vectors capturing semantic term?document in-
formation as well as rich sentiment content.
The proposed model can leverage both con-
tinuous and multi-dimensional sentiment in-
formation as well as non-sentiment annota-
tions. We instantiate the model to utilize the
document-level sentiment polarity annotations
present in many online documents (e.g. star
ratings). We evaluate the model using small,
widely used sentiment and subjectivity cor-
pora and find it out-performs several previ-
ously introduced methods for sentiment clas-
sification. We also introduce a large dataset
of movie reviews to serve as a more robust
benchmark for work in this area.
