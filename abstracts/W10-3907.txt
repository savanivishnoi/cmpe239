We analyzed the details of aWeb-derived
distributional data of Japanese nominal
terms with two aims. One aim is to
examine if distributionally similar terms
can be in fact equated with ?semanti-
cally similar? terms, and if so to what
extent. The other is to investigate into
what kind of semantic relations con-
stitute (strongly) distributionally similar
terms. Our results show that over 85%
of the pairs of the terms derived from
the highly similar terms turned out to
be semantically similar in some way.
The ratio of ?classmate,? synonymous,
hypernym-hyponym, and meronymic re-
lations are about 62%, 17%, 8% and 1%
of the classified data, respectively.
