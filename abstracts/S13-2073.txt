 
In this paper, we describe the development 
and performance of the supervised system 
UMCC_DLSI-(SA). This system uses corpora 
where phrases are annotated as Positive, 
Negative, Objective, and Neutral, to achieve 
new sentiment resources involving word 
dictionaries with their associated polarity. As 
a result, new sentiment inventories are 
obtained and applied in conjunction with 
detected informal patterns, to tackle the 
challenges posted in Task 2b of the Semeval-
2013 competition. Assessing the effectiveness 
of our application in sentiment classification, 
we obtained a 69% F-Measure for neutral and 
an average of 43% F-Measure for positive 
and negative using Tweets and SMS 
messages.
