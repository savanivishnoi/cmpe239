This article describes a Sentiment Analysis
(SA) system named senti.ue-en, built
for participation in SemEval-2013 Task 2, a
Twitter SA challenge. In both challenge sub-
tasks we used the same supervised machine
learning approach, including two classifiers in
pipeline, with 22 semantic oriented features,
such as polarized term presence and index,
and negation presence. Our system achieved
a better score on Task A (0.7413) than in the
Task B (0.4785). In the first subtask, there is
a better result for SMS than the obtained for
the more trained type of data, the tweets.
