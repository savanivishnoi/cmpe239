In this paper we describe our 
participation in the SIGHAN 2010 Task-
3 (Person Name Disambiguation) and 
detail our approaches. Person Name 
Disambiguation is typically viewed as an 
unsupervised clustering problem where 
the aim is to partition a name?s contexts 
into different clusters, each representing 
a real world people. The key point of 
Clustering is the similarity measure of 
context, which depends upon the features 
selection and representation. Two 
clustering algorithms, HAC and 
DBSCAN, are investigated in our system. 
The experiments show that the topic 
features learned by LDA outperforms
token features and more robust.
