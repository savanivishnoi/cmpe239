This paper introduces an approach to sentiment
analysis which uses support vector machines
(SVMs) to bring together diverse sources of po-
tentially pertinent information, including several fa-
vorability measures for phrases and adjectives and,
where available, knowledge of the topic of the
text. Models using the features introduced are fur-
ther combined with unigram models which have
been shown to be effective in the past (Pang et
al., 2002) and lemmatized versions of the unigram
models. Experiments on movie review data from
Epinions.com demonstrate that hybrid SVMs which
combine unigram-style feature-based SVMs with
those based on real-valued favorability measures
obtain superior performance, producing the best re-
sults yet published using this data. Further experi-
ments using a feature set enriched with topic infor-
mation on a smaller dataset of music reviews hand-
annotated for topic are also reported, the results of
which suggest that incorporating topic information
into such models may also yield improvement.
