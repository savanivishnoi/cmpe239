We describe an architecture that allows
to combine statistical machine translation
(SMT) with rule-based machine translation
(RBMT) in a multi-engine setup. We use a
variant of standard SMT technology to align
translations from one or more RBMT sys-
tems with the source text. We incorporate
phrases extracted from these alignments into
the phrase table of the SMT system and use
the open-source decoder Moses to find good
combinations of phrases from SMT training
data with the phrases derived from RBMT.
First experiments based on this hybrid archi-
tecture achieve promising results.
