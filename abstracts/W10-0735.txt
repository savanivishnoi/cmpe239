The source text provided to a machine translation
system is typically only one of many ways the input
sentence could have been expressed, and alternative
forms of expression can often produce a better trans-
lation. We introduce here error driven paraphras-
ing of source sentences: instead of paraphrasing a
source sentence exhaustively, we obtain paraphrases
for only the parts that are predicted to be problematic
for the translation system. We report on an Amazon
Mechanical Turk study that explores this idea, and
establishes via an oracle evaluation that it holds the
potential to substantially improve translation quality.
