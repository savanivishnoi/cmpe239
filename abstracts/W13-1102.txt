Does phonological variation get transcribed
into social media text? This paper investigates
examples of the phonological variable of con-
sonant cluster reduction in Twitter. Not only
does this variable appear frequently, but it dis-
plays the same sensitivity to linguistic context
as in spoken language. This suggests that when
social media writing transcribes phonological
properties of speech, it is not merely a case of
inventing orthographic transcriptions. Rather,
social media displays influence from structural
properties of the phonological system.
