Opinion Mining aims to automatically acquire 
useful opinioned information and knowledge 
in subjective texts. Research of Chinese Opin-
ioned Mining requires the support of annotated 
corpus for Chinese opinioned-subjective texts. 
To facilitate the work of corpus annotators, 
this paper implements an active learning based 
annotation tool for Chinese opinioned ele-
ments which can identify topic, sentiment, and 
opinion holder in a sentence automatically.
