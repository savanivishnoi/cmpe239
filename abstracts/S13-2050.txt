Word sense induction aims to discover differ-
ent senses of a word from a corpus by us-
ing unsupervised learning approaches. Once a
sense inventory is obtained for an ambiguous
word, word sense discrimination approaches
choose the best-fitting single sense for a given
context from the induced sense inventory.
However, there may not be a clear distinction
between one sense and another, although for
a context, more than one induced sense can
be suitable. Graded word sense method al-
lows for labeling a word in more than one
sense. In contrast to the most common ap-
proach which is to apply clustering or graph
partitioning on a representation of first or sec-
ond order co-occurrences of a word, we pro-
pose a system that creates a substitute vec-
tor for each target word from the most likely
substitutes suggested by a statistical language
model. Word samples are then taken accord-
ing to probabilities of these substitutes and the
results of the co-occurrence model are clus-
tered. This approach outperforms the other
systems on graded word sense induction task
in SemEval-2013.
