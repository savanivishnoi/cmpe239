: Text recognition systems require the use of contextual information in 
order to maximise the accuracy of their output. However, the acquisition of such 
knowledge for a realistically sized vocabulary presents a major problem. This paper 
describes methods for extracting contextual knowledge from text corpora, and 
demonstrates it  contribution to the performance of handwriting recognition systems.
