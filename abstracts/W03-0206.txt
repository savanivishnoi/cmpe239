This paper focuses on the transformation of
grammar checking technology into a learn-
ing environment for second language writing.
Our starting point is a grammar checker for
Swedish, called Granska. Two studies have
been conducted aimed at exploring the use of
computer support for writing in the context of
second language learning. In the first study, we
developed a methodology to study naturalistic
writing, and the impact of the grammar checker
on the writer?s text. In the second study, we
were interested in how the methodology de-
veloped earlier would work in an educational
setting. The problems with false alarms and
limited recall are definitely a sensitive issue
in the context of second language learners and
educational settings. Both learners and teach-
ers are concerned about the false alarms, and
without perfectly working text analyzers, new
strategies for dealing with these problems have
to be further explored and developed together
with learners and teachers.
