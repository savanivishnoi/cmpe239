 
In this paper, we describe a new model 
for word alignment in statistical trans- 
lation and present experimental results. 
The idea of the model is to make the 
alignment probabilities dependent on the 
differences in the alignment positions 
rather than on the absolute positions. 
To achieve this goal, the approach us- 
es a first-order Hidden Markov model 
(HMM) for the word alignment problem 
as they are used successfully in speech 
recognition for the time alignment prob- 
lem. The difference to the time align- 
ment HMM is that there is no monotony 
constraint for the possible word order- 
ings. We describe the details of the mod- 
el and test the model on several bilingual 
corpora.
