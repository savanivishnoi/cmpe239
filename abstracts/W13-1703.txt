We describe the NUS Corpus of Learner En-
glish (NUCLE), a large, fully annotated cor-
pus of learner English that is freely available
for research purposes. The goal of the cor-
pus is to provide a large data resource for the
development and evaluation of grammatical
error correction systems. Although NUCLE
has been available for almost two years, there
has been no reference paper that describes the
corpus in detail. In this paper, we address
this need. We describe the annotation schema
and the data collection and annotation process
of NUCLE. Most importantly, we report on
an unpublished study of annotator agreement
for grammatical error correction. Finally, we
present statistics on the distribution of gram-
matical errors in the NUCLE corpus.
