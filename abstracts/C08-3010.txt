 
In this paper, we will describe a search tool 
for a huge set of ngrams. The tool supports 
queries with an arbitrary number of wild-
cards. It takes a fraction of a second for a 
search, and can provide the fillers of the 
wildcards. The system runs on a single 
Linux PC with reasonable size memory (less 
than 4GB) and disk space (less than 400GB). 
This system can be a very useful tool for 
linguistic knowledge discovery and other 
NLP tasks.
