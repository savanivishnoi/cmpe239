 
We describe the adaptation for Arabic of 
the grammar-based MedSLT medical 
speech system. The system supports simple 
medical diagnosis questions about head-
aches using vocabulary of 322 words. We 
show that the MedSLT architecture based 
on motivated general grammars produces 
very good results, with a limited effort. 
Based on the grammars for other languages 
covered by the system, it is in fact very 
easy to develop an Arabic grammar and to 
specialize it efficiently for the different 
system tasks. In this paper, we focus on 
generation.
