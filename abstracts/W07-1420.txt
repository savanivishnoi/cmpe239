This paper presents two systems for textual
entailment, both employing decision trees
as a supervised learning algorithm. The
first one is based primarily on the con-
cept of lexical overlap, considering a bag of
words similarity overlap measure to form a
mapping of terms in the hypothesis to the
source text. The second system is a lexico-
semantic matching between the text and the
hypothesis that attempts an alignment be-
tween chunks in the hypothesis and chunks
in the text, and a representation of the text
and hypothesis as two dependency graphs.
Their performances are compared and their
positive and negative aspects are analyzed.
