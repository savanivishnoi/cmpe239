Recent advances in statistical machine
translation have used beam search for
approximate NP-complete inference within
probabilistic translation models. We present
an alternative approach of sampling from the
posterior distribution defined by a translation
model. We define a novel Gibbs sampler
for sampling translations given a source
sentence and show that it effectively explores
this posterior distribution. In doing so
we overcome the limitations of heuristic
beam search and obtain theoretically sound
solutions to inference problems such as
finding the maximum probability translation
and minimum expected risk training and
decoding.
