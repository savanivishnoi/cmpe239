Based on a study of verb translations in
the Europarl corpus, we argue that a wide
range of MWE patterns can be identified in
translations that exhibit a correspondence
between a single lexical item in the source
language and a group of lexical items in
the target language. We show that these
correspondences can be reliably detected
on dependency-parsed, word-aligned sen-
tences. We propose an extraction method
that combines word alignment with syn-
tactic filters and is independent of the
structural pattern of the translation.
