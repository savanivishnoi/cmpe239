 
A picture is worth a thousand words. 
Biomedical researchers tend to incorpo-
rate a significant number of images (i.e., 
figures or tables) in their publications to 
report experimental results, to present re-
search models, and to display examples of 
biomedical objects. Unfortunately, this 
wealth of information remains virtually 
inaccessible without automatic systems to 
organize these images. We explored su-
pervised machine-learning systems using 
Support Vector Machines to automatically 
classify images into six representative 
categories based on text, image, and the 
fusion of both. Our experiments show a 
significant improvement in the average F-
score of the fusion classifier (73.66%) as 
compared with classifiers just based on 
image (50.74%) or text features (68.54%).
