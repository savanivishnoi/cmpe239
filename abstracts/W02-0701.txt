 
To achieve translation technology that 
is adequate for speech-to-speech 
translation (S2S), this paper introduces 
a new attempt named Corpus-Centered 
Computation, (abbreviated to C3 and 
pronounced c-cube). As opposed to 
conventional approaches adopted by 
machine translation systems for 
written language, C3 places corpora at 
the center of the technology. For 
example, translation knowledge is 
extracted from corpora, translation 
quality is gauged by referring to 
corpora and the corpora themselves are 
normalized by paraphrasing or 
filtering. High-quality translation has 
been demonstrated in the domain of 
travel conversation, and the prospects 
of this approach are promising due to 
the benefits of synergistic effects.
