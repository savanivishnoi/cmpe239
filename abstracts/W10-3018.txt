Our CoNLL-2010 speculative sentence
detector disambiguates putative keywords
based on the following considerations: a
speculative keyword may be composed of
one or more word tokens; a speculative
sentence may have one or more specula-
tive keywords; and if a sentence contains
at least one real speculative keyword, it is
deemed speculative. A tree kernel classi-
fier is used to assess whether a potential
speculative keyword conveys speculation.
We exploit information implicit in tree
structures. For prediction efficiency, only
a segment of the whole tree around a spec-
ulation keyword is considered, along with
morphological features inside the segment
and information about the containing doc-
ument. A maximum entropy classifier
is used for sentences not covered by the
tree kernel classifier. Experiments on the
Wikipedia data set show that our system
achieves 0.55 F-measure (in-domain).
