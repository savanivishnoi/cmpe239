We develop a model of preposition definitions
in a machine-readable dictionary using the
theory of labeled directed graphs and analyze
the resulting digraphs to determine a primitive
set of preposition senses. We characterize
these primitives and show how they can be
used to develop an inheritance hierarchy for
prepositions, representing the definitions by a
type and slots for its arguments. By analyzing
the definitions, we develop criteria for
disambiguating among the highly polysemous
primitives. We show how these criteria can be
used in developing the inheritance hierarchy
and how they may be used in assigning theta
roles to the objects of transitive verbs. Finally,
we describe the use of the disambiguation
criteria to parse and represent the meaning of
the prepositions as used in encyclopedia
articles.
