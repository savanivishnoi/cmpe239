We present a systematic study of the effect of
crowdsourced translations on Machine Trans-
lation performance. We compare Machine
Translation systems trained on the same data
but with translations obtained using Amazon?s
Mechanical Turk vs. professional translations,
and show that the same performance is ob-
tained from Mechanical Turk translations at
1/5th the cost. We also show that adding a Me-
chanical Turk reference translation of the de-
velopment set improves parameter tuning and
output evaluation.
