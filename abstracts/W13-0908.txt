 
We aim to investigate cross-cultural patterns 
of thought through cross-linguistic investiga-
tion of the use of metaphor.  As a first step, 
we produce a system for locating instances of 
metaphor in English and Spanish text.  In con-
trast to previous work which relies on re-
sources like syntactic parsing and WordNet, 
our system is based on LDA topic modeling, 
enabling its application even to low-resource 
languages, and requires no labeled data.  We 
achieve an F-score of 59% for English.
