This paper presents a first experience with evalu-
ating sytems that address the issue of Logic Form
Identification (LFi). A Gold Standard approach was
used in which experts provide solutions to test data.
The expert solutions, the gold standard, are then
compared against outputs from participanting sys-
tems and different metrics observed. We proposed
a few novel metrics, including precision and recall,
that are further used to provide comparative results.
The test data included 4155 arguments and 2398
predicates grouped in 300 sentences.
