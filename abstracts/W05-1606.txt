Algorithms for generating referring expressions 
typically assume that an object in a scenary can be 
identified through a set of commonly agreed 
properties. This is a strong assumption, since in 
reality properties of objects may be perceived differ-
ently among people, due to a number of factors 
including vagueness, knowledge discrepancies, and 
limited perception capabilities. Taking these discre-
pancies into account, we reinterpret concepts of 
algorithms generating referring expressions in view 
of uncertainties about the appearance of objects. Our 
model includes two complementary measures of 
likelihood in object identification, and adapted 
property selection and termination criteria. The 
approach is relevant for situations with potential 
perception problems and for scenarios with knowl-
edge discrepancies between conversants.
