This paper discusses two problems that arise
in the Generation of Referring Expressions:
(a) numeric-valued attributes, such as size or
location; (b) perspective-taking in reference.
Both problems, it is argued, can be resolved
if some structure is imposed on the available
knowledge prior to content determination. We
describe a clustering algorithm which is suffi-
ciently general to be applied to these diverse
problems, discuss its application, and evaluate
its performance.
