We present a supervised learning approach to
cross-lingual textual entailment that explores
statistical word alignment models to predict
entailment relations between sentences writ-
ten in different languages. Our approach
is language independent, and was used to
participate in the CLTE task (Task#8) or-
ganized within Semeval 2013 (Negri et al,
2013). The four runs submitted, one for
each language combination covered by the test
data (i.e. Spanish/English, German/English,
French/English and Italian/English), achieved
encouraging results. In terms of accuracy,
performance ranges from 38.8% (for Ger-
man/English) to 43.2% (for Italian/English).
On the Italian/English and Spanish/English
test sets our systems ranked second among
five participants, close to the top results (re-
spectively 43.4% and 45.4%).
