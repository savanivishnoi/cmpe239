  
The translation choice and transfer modules 
in an English Chinese machine translation 
system are introduced. The translation 
choice is realized on basis of a grammar tree 
and takes the context as a word bag, with the 
lexicon and POS tag information as context 
features. The Bayes minimal error 
probability is taken as the evaluation 
function of the candidate translation. The 
rule-based transfer and generation module 
takes the parsing tree as the input and 
operates on the information of POS tag, 
semantics or even the lexicon.
