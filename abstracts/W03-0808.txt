 
Information extraction (IE) systems assist 
analysts to assimilate information from 
electronic documents. This paper focuses on 
IE tasks designed to support information 
discovery applications. Since information 
discovery implies examining large volumes 
of documents drawn from various sources for 
situations that cannot be anticipated a priori, 
they require IE systems to have breadth as 
well as depth. This implies the need for a 
domain-independent IE system that can 
easily be customized for specific domains: 
end users must be given tools to customize 
the system on their own. It also implies the 
need for defining new intermediate level IE 
tasks that are richer than the 
subject-verb-object (SVO) triples produced 
by shallow systems, yet not as complex as the 
domain-specific scenarios defined by the 
Message Understanding Conference (MUC). 
This paper describes a robust, scalable IE 
engine designed for such purposes. It 
describes new IE tasks such as entity profiles, 
and concept-based general events which 
represent realistic goals in terms of what can 
be accomplished in the near-term as well as 
providing useful, actionable information. 
These new tasks also facilitate the correlation 
of output from an IE engine with existing 
structured data. Benchmarking results for the 
core engine and applications utilizing the 
engine are presented.
