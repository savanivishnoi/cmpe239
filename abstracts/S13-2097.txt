We present a 5-way supervised system based
on syntactic-semantic similarity features. The
model deploys: Text overlap measures,
WordNet-based lexical similarities, graph-
based similarities, corpus-based similarities,
syntactic structure overlap and predicate-
argument overlap measures. These measures
are applied to question, reference answer and
student answer triplets. We take into account
the negation in the syntactic and predicate-
argument overlap measures. Our system uses
the domain-specific data as one dataset to
build a robust system. The results show that
our system is above the median and mean on
all the evaluation scenarios of the SemEval-
2013 task #7.
