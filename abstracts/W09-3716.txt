In this paper we introduce a methodology for annotating compo-
sitional operations in natural language text, and describe a mark-up
language, GLML, based on Generative Lexicon, for identifying such
relations. While most annotation systems capture surface relation-
ships, GLML captures the ?compositional history? of the argument
selection relative to the predicate. We provide a brief overview of GL
before moving on to our proposed methodology for annotating with
GLML. There are three main tasks described in the paper: (i) Com-
positional mechanisms of argument selection; (ii) Qualia in modifica-
tion constructions; (iii) Type selection in modification of dot objects.
We explain what each task includes and provide a description of the
annotation interface. We also include the XML format for GLML in-
cluding examples of annotated sentences.
