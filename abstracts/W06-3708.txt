system, S-MINDS, interprets between 
provider and patient in routine medical 
interactions with very high accuracy. 
Optimizing the system for new tasks 
or languages requires very little data. 
New developments include a hybrid 
translation approach that allows 
participants to say complex or out-of-
domain utterances, the expansion of 
hands-free functionality, and the 
ability to deliver the most urgent 
expressions instantaneously.
