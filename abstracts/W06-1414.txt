This paper presents a method of querying
databases by means of a natural language-
like interface which offers the advantage
of minimal configuration necessary for
porting the system. The method allows
us to first automatically infer the set of
possible queries that can apply to a given
database, automatically generate a lexicon
and grammar rules for expressing these
queries, and then provide users with an
interface that allows them to pose these
queries in natural language without the
well-known limitations of most natural
language interfaces to databases. The way
the queries are inferred and constructed
means that semantic translation is per-
formed with perfect reliability.
