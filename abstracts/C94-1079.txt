principle-based parser for English. The parser 
has been implemented in C++ and runs on 
SUN Sparcstations with X-windows. It con- 
rains a lexicon with over 90,000 entries, con- 
structed automatically b  applying a set of ex- 
traction and conversion rules to entries from 
machine readable dictionaries.
