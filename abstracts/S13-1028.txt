Soft cardinality has been shown to be a very
strong text-overlapping baseline for the task of
measuring semantic textual similarity (STS),
obtaining 3rd place in SemEval-2012. At
*SEM-2013 shared task, beside the plain text-
overlapping approach, we tested within soft
cardinality two distributional word-similarity
functions derived from the ukWack corpus.
Unfortunately, we combined these measures
with other features using regression, obtain-
ing positions 18th, 22nd and 23rd among the
90 participants systems in the official rank-
ing. Already after the release of the gold stan-
dard annotations of the test data, we observed
that using only the similarity measures with-
out combining them with other features would
have obtained positions 6th, 7th and 8th; more-
over, an arithmetic average of these similarity
measures would have been 4th(mean=0.5747).
This paper describes both the 3 systems as
they were submitted and the similarity mea-
sures that would obtained those better results.
