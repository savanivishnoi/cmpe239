  
This paper presents a study of the effects of 
syntax and melodic configuration on turn-
taking in Southern British English. Using 
dialogue materials, two perception 
experiments were carried out. In the first, 
subjects heard dialogue fragments in which 
syntactic completeness and melodic contour 
were systematically varied, and were asked 
whether they expected a subsequent turn 
exchange or not. In the second, subjects 
were presented with short speaker 
exchanges taken from the same material, 
and asked whether they thought the first 
speaker had intended to cede the turn or not. 
The results suggest that syntactic completion 
or non-completion is the main factor in 
predicting turn-taking behaviour. Only one 
melodic contour, the high level tone H* %, 
appears to operate as a turn holding device, 
regardless of whether the utterance is 
grammatically complete or not. The results 
of this study were found to be similar to 
those of a study of Dutch turn-taking.
