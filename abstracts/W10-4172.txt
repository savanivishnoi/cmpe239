 
This paper details our experiments 
carried out at Word Sense Induction task. 
For the foreign language (especially 
English), there have been many studies 
of word sense induction (WSI), and the 
approaches and the techniques are more 
and more mature. However, the study of 
Chinese WSI is just getting started, and 
there has not been a better way to solve 
the problems encountered. WSI can be 
divided into two categories: supervised 
manner and unsupervised manner. But in 
the light of the high cost of supervised 
manner, we introduce novel solutions to 
automatic and unsupervised WSI. In this 
paper, we propose two different systems. 
The first one is called K-means-based 
Chinese word sense induction in an 
unsupervised manner while the second 
one is graph-based Chinese word sense 
induction. In the experiments, the first 
system has achieved a 0.7729 Fscore on 
average while the second one has 
achieved a 0.6067 Fscore.
