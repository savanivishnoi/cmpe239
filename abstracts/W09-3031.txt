In this paper, we present preliminary work on
corpus-based anaphora resolution of discourse
deixis in German. Our annotation guidelines
provide linguistic tests for locating the antecedent,
and for determining the semantic types of both the
antecedent and the anaphor. The corpus consists of
selected speaker turns from the Europarl corpus.
