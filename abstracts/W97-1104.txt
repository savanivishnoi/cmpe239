 
A deductive approach is used to predict vowel 
and consonant places of articulation. Based on 
two main criteria, viz. simple and efficient use of 
an acoustic tube, along with maximum acoustic 
dispersion, the Distinctive Regions Model 
(DRM) of speech production derives regions 
that closely correspond to established vowel and 
consonant places of articulation.
