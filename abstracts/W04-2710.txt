High-quality lexical resources are needed to
both train and evaluate Word Sense Disam-
biguation (WSD) systems. The problem of am-
biguity persists even in limited domains, thus
the necessity for wide-coverage inventories of
senses (dictionaries) and corpora sense-tagged
to them. WordNet has been used extensively
for WSD, for both its broad coverage and its
large network of semantic relations. In this
paper, we present a report on the state of our
current endeavor to increase the connectivity
of WordNet through sense-tagging the glosses,
the result of which will be to create a more in-
tegrated lexical resource.
