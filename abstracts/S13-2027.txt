This paper presents an approach for gener-
ating free paraphrases of compounds (task 4
at SemEval 2013) by decomposing the train-
ing data into a collection of templates and
fillers and recombining/scoring these based on
a generative language model and discrimina-
tive MaxEnt reranking.
The system described in this paper achieved
the highest score (with a very small margin) in
the (default) isomorphic setting of the scorer,
for which it was optimized, at a disadvantage
to the non-isomorphic score.
