usually been produced for such specific domains as 
health care or military use. Ideally, such systems 
would be easily portable to other domains in which 
translation is mission critical, such as emergency 
response or law enforcement. However, porting has in 
practice proven difficult. This paper will comment on 
the sources of this difficulty and briefly present an 
approach to rapid inter-domain portability. Three 
aspects will be discussed: (1) large general-purpose 
lexicons for automatic speech recognition and 
machine translation, made reliable and usable through 
interactive facilities for monitoring and correcting 
errors; (2) easily modifiable facilities for instant 
translation of frequent phrases; and (3) quickly 
modifiable custom glossaries. As support for our 
approach, we apply our current SLT system, now 
optimized for the health care domain, to sample 
utterances from the military, emergency service, and 
law enforcement domains, with discussion of 
numerous specific sentences.
