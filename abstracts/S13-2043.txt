We introduce Peripheral Diversity (PD) as a
knowledge-based approach to achieve multi-
lingual Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).
PD exploits the frequency and diverse use
of word senses in semantic subgraphs de-
rived from larger sense inventories such as
BabelNet, Wikipedia, and WordNet in order
to achieve WSD. PD?s f -measure scores for
SemEval 2013 Task 12 outperform the Most
Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline for two of
the five languages: English, French, German,
Italian, and Spanish. Despite PD remain-
ing under-developed and under-explored, it
demonstrates that it is robust, competitive, and
encourages development.
