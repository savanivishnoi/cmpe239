In SemEval-2007, CL Research participated in
the task for Frame Semantic Structure
Extraction. Participation in this task was used as
the vehicle for efforts to integrate and exploit
FrameNet in a comprehensive text processing
system. In particular, this involved steps to build
a FrameNet dictionary with CL Research?s
DIMAP dictionary software and to use this
dictionary (along with its semantic network
processing capabilities) in processing text into
XML representations. Implementation of the
entire integrated package is only in its initial
stages and was used to make only a bare
submission of frame identification. On this task,
over all texts, a recall of 0.372, a precision of
0.553, and an F-score of 0.445 were achieved.
Considering only targets included in the DIMAP
FrameNet dictionary, the overall F-score is
0.605. These results, competitive with the top
scoring system, support continued attempts at a
dictionary-based approach to frame structure
extraction.
