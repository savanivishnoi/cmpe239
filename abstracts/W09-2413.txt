We propose a multilingual unsupervised Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task for a sample of
English nouns. Instead of providing manually sense-
tagged examples for each sense of a polysemous
noun, our sense inventory is built up on the basis of
the Europarl parallel corpus. The multilingual setup
involves the translations of a given English polyse-
mous noun in five supported languages, viz. Dutch,
French, German, Spanish and Italian.
The task targets the following goals: (a) the man-
ual creation of a multilingual sense inventory for a
lexical sample of English nouns and (b) the eval-
uation of systems on their ability to disambiguate
new occurrences of the selected polysemous nouns.
For the creation of the hand-tagged gold standard,
all translations of a given polysemous English noun
are retrieved in the five languages and clustered by
meaning. Systems can participate in 5 bilingual
evaluation subtasks (English - Dutch, English - Ger-
man, etc.) and in a multilingual subtask covering all
language pairs.
As WSD from cross-lingual evidence is gaining
popularity, we believe it is important to create a mul-
tilingual gold standard and run cross-lingual WSD
benchmark tests.
