We present SMMR, a scalable sentence
scoring method for query-oriented up-
date summarization. Sentences are scored
thanks to a criterion combining query rele-
vance and dissimilarity with already read
documents (history). As the amount of
data in history increases, non-redundancy
is prioritized over query-relevance. We
show that SMMR achieves promising re-
sults on the DUC 2007 update corpus.
