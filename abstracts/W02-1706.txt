We describe the use of a suite of highly flexible
XML-based NLP tools in a project for processing and
interpreting text in the medical domain. The main
aim of the paper is to demonstrate the central role
that XML mark-up and XML NLP tools have played
in the analysis process and to describe the resultant
annotated corpus of MEDLINE abstracts. In addition
to the XML tools, we have succeeded in integrating
a variety of non-XML ?off the shelf? NLP tools into
our pipelines, so that their output is added into the
mark-up. We demonstrate the utility of the anno-
tations that result in two ways. First, we investigate
how they can be used to improve parse coverage of a
hand-crafted grammar that generates logical forms.
And second, we investigate how they contribute to
automatic lexical semantic acquisition processes.
