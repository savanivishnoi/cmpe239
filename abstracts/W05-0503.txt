 
Unsupervised learning of grammar is a 
problem that can be important in many 
areas ranging from text preprocessing 
for information retrieval and 
classification to machine translation. 
We describe an MDL based grammar 
of a language that contains morphology 
and lexical categories. We use an 
unsupervised learner of morphology to 
bootstrap the acquisition of lexical 
categories and use these two learning 
processes iteratively to help and 
constrain each other. To be able to do 
so, we need to make our existing 
morphological analysis less fine 
grained. We present an algorithm for 
collapsing morphological classes 
(signatures) by using syntactic context. 
Our experiments demonstrate that this 
collapse preserves the relation between 
morphology and lexical categories 
within new signatures, and thereby 
minimizes the description length of the 
model.
