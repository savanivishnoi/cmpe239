The paper deals with conditional responses of the
form ?Not if c/Yes if c? in reply to a question ??q?
in the context of information-seeking dialogues. A
conditional response is triggered if the obtainability
of q depends on whether c holds: The response in-
dicates a possible need to find alternative solutions,
opening a negotiation in the dialogue. The paper
discusses the conditions under which conditional
responses are appropriate, and proposes a uniform
approach to their generation and interpretation.
