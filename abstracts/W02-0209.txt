  
We present a new framework for rapid 
development of mixed-initiative dialog 
systems. Using this framework, a developer 
can author sophisticated dialog systems for 
multiple channels of interaction by 
specifying an interaction modality, a rich 
task hierarchy and task parameters, and 
domain-specific modules.  The framework 
includes a dialog history that tracks input, 
output, and results. We present the 
framework and preliminary results in two 
application domains.
