We describe a substitution-based system for
hybrid machine translation (MT) that has been
extended with machine learning components
controlling its phrase selection. The approach
is based on a rule-based MT (RBMT) system
which creates template translations. Based
on the rule-based generation parse tree and
target-to-target algnments, we identify the set
of ?interesting? translation candidates from
one or more translation engines which could
be substituted into our translation templates.
The substitution process is either controlled by
the output from a binary classifier trained on
feature vectors from the different MT engines,
or it is depending on weights for the decision
factors, which have been tuned using MERT.
We are able to observe improvements in terms
of BLEU scores over a baseline version of the
hybrid system.
