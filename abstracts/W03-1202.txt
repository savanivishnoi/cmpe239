  
We explore the problem of single 
sentence summarisation.  In the news 
domain, such a summary might 
resemble a headline.  The headline 
generation system we present uses 
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to 
guide the generation of a headline 
towards the theme that best represents 
the document to be summarised.   In 
doing so, the intuition is that the 
generated summary will more accurately 
reflect the content of the source 
document.  This paper presents SVD as 
an alternative method to determine if a 
word is a suitable candidate for 
inclusion in the headline.  The results of 
a recall based evaluation comparing 
three different strategies to word 
selection, indicate that thematic 
information does help improve recall.
