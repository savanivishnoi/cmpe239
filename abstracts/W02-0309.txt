Document retrieval in languages with
a rich and complex morphology ? par-
ticularly in terms of derivation and
(single-word) composition ? suffers from
serious performance degradation with the
stemming-only query-term-to-text-word
matching paradigm. We propose an
alternative approach in which morpholog-
ically complex word forms are segmented
into relevant subwords (such as stems,
named entities, acronyms), and subwords
constitute the basic unit for indexing and
retrieval. We evaluate our approach on a
large biomedical document collection.
