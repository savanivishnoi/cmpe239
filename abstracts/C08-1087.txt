Quickly moving to a new area of research
is painful for researchers due to the vast
amount of scientific literature in each field
of study. One possible way to overcome
this problem is to summarize a scientific
topic. In this paper, we propose a model of
summarizing a single article, which can be
further used to summarize an entire topic.
Our model is based on analyzing others?
viewpoint of the target article?s contribu-
tions and the study of its citation summary
network using a clustering approach.
