 
An approach to abductive inference developed in the TAC- 
ITUS project has resulted in a dramatic simplification of 
how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. Its 
use in solving the local pragmatics problems of reference, 
compound nominals, syntactic ambiguity, and metonymy 
is described and illustrated. It also suggests an elegant and 
thorough integration ofsyntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
