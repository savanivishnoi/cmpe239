 
A computationally relevant theory of lexical semantics must take into consideration 
both the form and the content of three different static knowledge sources -- the 
lexicon, the ontological domain model and a text meaning representation language. 
Meanings of lexical units axe interpreted in terms of their mappings into the ontology 
and/or their contributions to the text meaning representation. We briefly describe 
one such theory. Its precepts have been used in mONYSUS, a machine translation 
system prototype.
