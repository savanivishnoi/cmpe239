This paper describes the system MC-WSD pre-
sented for the English Lexical Sample task. The
system is based on a multicomponent architecture.
It consists of one classifier with two components.
One is trained on the data provided for the task. The
second is trained on this data and, additionally, on
an external training set extracted from the Wordnet
glosses. The goal of the additional component is to
lessen sparse data problems by exploiting the infor-
mation encoded in the ontology.
