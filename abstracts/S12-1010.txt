In this paper, we investigate a full-fledged
supervised machine learning framework for
identifying English phrasal verbs in a given
context. We concentrate on those that we de-
fine as the most confusing phrasal verbs, in the
sense that they are the most commonly used
ones whose occurrence may correspond either
to a true phrasal verb or an alignment of a sim-
ple verb with a preposition.
We construct a benchmark dataset1 with 1,348
sentences from BNC, annotated via an Inter-
net crowdsourcing platform. This dataset is
further split into two groups, more idiomatic
group which consists of those that tend to be
used as a true phrasal verb and more compo-
sitional group which tends to be used either
way. We build a discriminative classifier with
easily available lexical and syntactic features
and test it over the datasets. The classifier
overall achieves 79.4% accuracy, 41.1% er-
ror deduction compared to the corpus major-
ity baseline 65%. However, it is even more
interesting to discover that the classifier learns
more from the more compositional examples
than those idiomatic ones.
