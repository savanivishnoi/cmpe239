 
We present a method of inferring aspects of a 
person?s context by capturing conversation 
topics and using prior knowledge of human 
behavior. This paper claims that topic-spotting 
performance can be improved by using a large 
database of common sense knowledge. We 
describe two systems we built to infer context 
from noisy transcriptions of spoken conversa-
tions using common sense, and detail some 
preliminary results. The GISTER system uses 
OMCSNet, a commonsense semantic net-
work, to infer the most likely topics under dis-
cussion in a conversation stream. The 
OVERHEAR system is built on top of 
GISTER, and distinguishes between aspects 
of the conversation that refer to past, present, 
and future events by using LifeNet, a prob-
abilistic graphical model of human behavior, 
to help infer the events that occurred in each 
of those three time periods. We conclude by 
discussing some of the future directions we 
may take this work.
