Community question answering (CQA)
has become an increasingly popular re-
search topic. In this paper, we focus on the
problem of question retrieval. Question
retrieval in CQA can automatically find
the most relevant and recent questions that
have been solved by other users. However,
the word ambiguity and word mismatch
problems bring about new challenges for
question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art
approaches address these issues by implic-
itly expanding the queried questions with
additional words or phrases using mono-
lingual translation models. While use-
ful, the effectiveness of these models is
highly dependent on the availability of
quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g.,
question-answer pairs) in the absence of
which they are troubled by noise issue.
In this work, we propose an alternative
way to address the word ambiguity and
word mismatch problems by taking advan-
tage of potentially rich semantic informa-
tion drawn from other languages. Our pro-
posed method employs statistical machine
translation to improve question retrieval
and enriches the question representation
with the translated words from other lan-
guages via matrix factorization. Experi-
ments conducted on a real CQA data show
that our proposed approach is promising.
