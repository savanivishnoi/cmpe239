 
We present a data-driven variant of the LR 
algorithm for dependency parsing, and ex-
tend it with a best-first search for probabil-
istic generalized LR dependency parsing.  
Parser actions are determined by a classifi-
er, based on features that represent the cur-
rent state of the parser.  We apply this pars-
ing framework to both tracks of the CoNLL 
2007 shared task, in each case taking ad-
vantage of multiple models trained with 
different learners.  In the multilingual track, 
we train three LR models for each of the 
ten languages, and combine the analyses 
obtained with each individual model with a 
maximum spanning tree voting scheme.  In 
the domain adaptation track, we use two 
models to parse unlabeled data in the target 
domain to supplement the labeled out-of-
domain training set, in a scheme similar to 
one iteration of co-training.
