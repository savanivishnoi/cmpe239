The paper proposes a Constrained Entity-
Alignment F-Measure (CEAF) for evaluating
coreference resolution. The metric is com-
puted by aligning reference and system entities
(or coreference chains) with the constraint that
a system (reference) entity is aligned with at
most one reference (system) entity. We show
that the best alignment is a maximum bipartite
matching problem which can be solved by the
Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Comparative exper-
iments are conducted to show that the widely-
known MUC F-measure has serious flaws in
evaluating a coreference system. The proposed
metric is also compared with the ACE-Value,
the official evaluation metric in the Automatic
Content Extraction (ACE) task, and we con-
clude that the proposed metric possesses some
properties such as symmetry and better inter-
pretability missing in the ACE-Value.
