AKT is a major research project
applying a variety of technologies to
knowledge management. Knowledge
is a dynamic, ubiquitous resource,
which is to be found equally in an
expert's head, under terabytes of data,
or explicitly stated in manuals. AKT
will extend knowledge management
technologies to exploit the potential
of the semantic web, covering the use
of knowledge over its entire lifecycle,
from acquisition to maintenance and
deletion. In this paper we discuss how
HLT will be used in AKT and how
the use of HLT will affect different
areas of KM, such as knowledge
acquisition, retrieval and publishing.
