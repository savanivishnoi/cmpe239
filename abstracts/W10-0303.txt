Most computational approaches to metaphor
have focused on discerning between
metaphorical and literal text. Recent work
on computational metaphor identification
(CMI) instead seeks to identify overarching
conceptual metaphors by mapping selectional
preferences between source and target cor-
pora. This paper explores using semantic role
labeling (SRL) in CMI. Its goals are two-fold:
first, to demonstrate that semantic roles can
effectively be used to identify conceptual
metaphors, and second, to compare SRL to
the current use of typed dependency parsing
in CMI. The results show that SRL can be
used to identify potential metaphors and
that it overcomes some of the limitations
of using typed dependencies, but also that
SRL introduces its own set of complications.
The paper concludes by suggesting future
directions, both for evaluating the use of SRL
in CMI, and for fostering critical and creative
thinking about metaphors.
