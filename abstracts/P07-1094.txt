Unsupervised learning of linguistic structure
is a difficult problem. A common approach
is to define a generative model and max-
imize the probability of the hidden struc-
ture given the observed data. Typically,
this is done using maximum-likelihood es-
timation (MLE) of the model parameters.
We show using part-of-speech tagging that
a fully Bayesian approach can greatly im-
prove performance. Rather than estimating
a single set of parameters, the Bayesian ap-
proach integrates over all possible parame-
ter values. This difference ensures that the
learned structure will have high probability
over a range of possible parameters, and per-
mits the use of priors favoring the sparse
distributions that are typical of natural lan-
guage. Our model has the structure of a
standard trigram HMM, yet its accuracy is
closer to that of a state-of-the-art discrimi-
native model (Smith and Eisner, 2005), up
to 14 percentage points better than MLE. We
find improvements both when training from
data alone, and using a tagging dictionary.
