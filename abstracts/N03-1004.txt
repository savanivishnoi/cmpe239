Motivated by the success of ensemble methods
in machine learning and other areas of natu-
ral language processing, we developed a multi-
strategy and multi-source approach to question
answering which is based on combining the re-
sults from different answering agents searching
for answers in multiple corpora. The answer-
ing agents adopt fundamentally different strate-
gies, one utilizing primarily knowledge-based
mechanisms and the other adopting statistical
techniques. We present our multi-level answer
resolution algorithm that combines results from
the answering agents at the question, passage,
and/or answer levels. Experiments evaluating
the effectiveness of our answer resolution algo-
rithm show a 35.0% relative improvement over
our baseline system in the number of questions
correctly answered, and a 32.8% improvement
according to the average precision metric.
