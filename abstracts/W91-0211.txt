 
Lexical knowledge is knowledge that can be expressed in words. Circular though this may seem, 
we think it provides a perfectly reasonable point of departure, for, in line with a long-standing 
philosophical tradition it posits communicability as the most characteristic aspect of lexical 
knowledge. Knowledge representation systems hould be designed so as to fit lexical data rather 
than the other way round. A broad view of the possible scope of lexical semantics would thus be 
one which tries to chart out the systematic, generalizable aspects of word meanings, and of the 
relations between words, drawing on readily accessible sources of lexical knowledge, such as 
machine readable dictionaries, encyclopedias, and representative corpora, coupled with the kind of 
analytic apparatus that is needed to fruitfully explore such sources, for instance custom-built 
parsers to cope with dictionary definitions (Vossen 1990), statistical programs to deal with the 
distributional properties of lexical items in large corpora (Church & Hanks 1990) etc. At the same 
time this kind of massive data-acquisition should be made sensitive to the borders between 
perceptual experience, lexical knowledge and expert knowledge.
