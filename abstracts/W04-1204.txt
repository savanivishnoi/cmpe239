 
Although there have been many research pro-
jects to extract protein pathways, most such infor-
mation still exists only in the scientific literature, 
usually written in natural languages and defying 
data mining efforts. We present a novel and robust 
approach for extracting protein-protein interactions 
from the literature. Our method uses a dynamic 
programming algorithm to compute distinguishing 
patterns by aligning relevant sentences and key 
verbs that describe protein interactions. A match-
ing algorithm is designed to extract the interactions 
between proteins. Equipped only with a protein 
name dictionary, our system achieves a recall rate 
of about 80.0% and a precision rate of about 80.5%.
