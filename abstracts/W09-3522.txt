 
This paper presents a transliteration system 
based on pair Hidden Markov Model (pair 
HMM) training and Weighted Finite State 
Transducer (WFST) techniques. Parameters 
used by WFSTs for transliteration generation 
are learned from a pair HMM. Parameters 
from pair-HMM training on English-Russian 
data sets are found to give better transliteration 
quality than parameters trained for WFSTs for 
corresponding structures. Training a pair 
HMM on English vowel bigrams and standard 
bigrams for Cyrillic Romanization, and using 
a few transformation rules on generated Rus-
sian transliterations to test for context im-
proves the system?s transliteration quality.
