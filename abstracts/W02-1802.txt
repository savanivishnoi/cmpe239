  
Despite progress in the development of 
computational means, human input is still 
critical in the production of consistent and 
useable aligned corpora and term banks. This 
is especially true for specialized corpora and 
term banks whose end-users are often 
professionals with very stringent 
requirements for accuracy, consistency and 
coverage. In the compilation of a high quality 
Chinese-English legal glossary for ELDoS 
project, we have identified a number of issues 
that make the role human input critical for 
term alignment and extraction. They include 
the identification of low frequency terms, 
paraphrastic expressions, discontinuous units, 
and maintaining consistent term granularity, 
etc. Although manual intervention can more 
satisfactorily address these issues, steps must 
also be taken to address intra- and 
inter-annotator inconsistency.
