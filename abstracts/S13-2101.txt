Assessing student understanding by evaluat-
ing their free text answers to posed questions
is a very important task. However, manually,
it is time-consuming and computationally, it is
difficult. This paper details our shallow NLP
approach to computationally assessing student
free text answers when a reference answer is
provided. For four out of the five test sets, our
system achieved an overall accuracy above the
median and mean.
