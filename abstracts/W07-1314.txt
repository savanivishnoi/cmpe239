We use an iterative process of multi-gram
alignment between associated words in dif-
ferent languages in an attempt to identify
cognates. To maximise the amount of data,
we use practical orthographies instead of
consistently coded phonetic transcriptions.
First results indicate that using practical or-
thographies can be useful, the more so when
dealing with large amounts of data.
