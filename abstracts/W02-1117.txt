 
The segmentation of Chinese texts is a key 
process in Chinese information processing. 
The difficulties in segmentation are the 
process of ambiguous character string and 
unknown Chinese words. In order to obtain 
the correct result, the first is identification of 
all possible candidates of Chinese words in a 
text. In this paper, a data structure 
Chinese-character-net is put forward, then, 
based on this character-net, a new algorithm 
is presented to obtain all possible candidate 
of Chinese words in a text. This paper gives 
the experiment result. Finally the 
characteristics of the algorithm are analysed. 
Keywords: segmentation, connection, 
character-net, ambiguity, unknown words.
