Most state-of-the-art evaluation measures
for machine translation assign high costs
to movements of word blocks. In many
cases though such movements still result
in correct or almost correct sentences. In
this paper, we will present a new eval-
uation measure which explicitly models
block reordering as an edit operation.
Our measure can be exactly calculated in
quadratic time.
Furthermore, we will show how some
evaluation measures can be improved
by the introduction of word-dependent
substitution costs. The correlation of the
new measure with human judgment has
been investigated systematically on two
different language pairs. The experimental
results will show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in
sentence-level correlation. Results from
experiments with word dependent substi-
tution costs will demonstrate an additional
increase of correlation between automatic
evaluation measures and human judgment.
