 
Voice over IP and the open source technologies are 
becoming popular choices for organizations. 
However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways 
these systems fail to attract the global users 
economically. The objective of this paper is to 
demonstrate how an existing web application can be 
modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual 
access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way 
for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a 
VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service 
provider (VSP) does not provide a local 
geographical number to global customers to access 
the application. In addition, we introduce an 
economical way for small sized businesses to 
overcome the high cost of setting up and using a 
commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is 
based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the 
entire process, we present a sample Package 
Tracking System application, which is based on an 
existing website and provides the same functionality 
as the website does. We also present an online 
demonstration, which provides global access to 
commercial voice platforms (i.e. Voxeo, Tellme 
Studio, Bevocal and DemandVoice). This paper also 
discusses various scenarios in which spoken 
interaction can play a significant role.
