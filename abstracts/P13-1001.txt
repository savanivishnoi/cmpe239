We introduce a shift-reduce parsing
algorithm for phrase-based string-to-
dependency translation. As the algorithm
generates dependency trees for partial
translations left-to-right in decoding, it
allows for efficient integration of both
n-gram and dependency language mod-
els. To resolve conflicts in shift-reduce
parsing, we propose a maximum entropy
model trained on the derivation graph of
training data. As our approach combines
the merits of phrase-based and string-to-
dependency models, it achieves significant
improvements over the two baselines on
the NIST Chinese-English datasets.
