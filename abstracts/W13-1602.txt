We present a bootstrapping algorithm to au-
tomatically learn hashtags that convey emo-
tion. Using the bootstrapping framework, we
learn lists of emotion hashtags from unlabeled
tweets. Our approach starts with a small num-
ber of seed hashtags for each emotion, which
we use to automatically label tweets as initial
training data. We then train emotion classi-
fiers and use them to identify and score candi-
date emotion hashtags. We select the hashtags
with the highest scores, use them to automat-
ically harvest new tweets from Twitter, and
repeat the bootstrapping process. We show
that the learned hashtag lists help to improve
emotion classification performance compared
to an N-gram classifier, obtaining 8% micro-
average and 9% macro-average improvements
in F-measure.
