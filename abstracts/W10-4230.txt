We present the UMUS (Universite? du
Maine/Universita?t Stuttgart) submission
for the NEG task at GREC?10. We re-
fined and tuned our 2009 system but we
still rely on predicting generic labels and
then choosing from the list of expressions
that match those labels. We handled recur-
sive expressions with care by generating
specific labels for all the possible embed-
dings. The resulting system performs at a
type accuracy of 0.84 an a string accuracy
of 0.81 on the development set.
