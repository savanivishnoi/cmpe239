As shown in the formal semantics litera-
ture, adjectives can display very different
inferential patterns depending on whether
they are intersective, privative, subsective
or plain non-subsective. Moreover, many
of these classes are often described using
second order constructs. In this paper, we
adopt Hobbs?s ontologically promiscuous
approach and present a first order treatment
of adjective semantics which opens the way
for a sophisticated treatment of adjectival
inference. The approach was implemented
and tested using first order automated rea-
soners.
