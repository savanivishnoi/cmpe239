In this paper, we propose a fine grained
classification of english adjectives geared
at modeling the distinct inference patterns
licensed by each adjective class. We show
how it can be implemented in description
logic and illustrate the predictions made
by a series of examples. The proposal has
been implemented using Description logic
as a semantic representation language and
the prediction verified using the DL theo-
rem prover RACER.
Topics: Textual Entailment, Adjectival Semantics
