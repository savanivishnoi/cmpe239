 
Previous work has argued that memory-based 
learning is better than abstraction-based learn-
ing for a set of language learning tasks. In this 
paper, we first attempt to generalize these re-
sults to a new set of language learning tasks 
from the area of spoken dialog systems and to 
a different abstraction-based learner. We then 
examine the utility of various exceptionality 
measures for predicting where one learner is 
better than the other. Our results show that 
generalization of previous results to our tasks 
is not so obvious and some of the exceptional-
ity measures may be used to characterize the 
performance of our learners.
