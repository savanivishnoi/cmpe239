 
Character-based tagging method has 
achieved great success in Chinese Word 
Segmentation (CWS). This paper 
proposes a new approach to improve the 
CWS tagging accuracy by combining 
Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with 
structured support vector machine 
(SVM) for utilization of enormous 
unlabeled text corpus. First, character 
N-grams are clustered and mapped into 
a low-dimensional space by adopting 
SOM algorithm. Two different maps are 
built based on the N-gram?s preceding 
and succeeding context respectively. 
Then new features are extracted from 
these maps and integrated into the 
structured SVM methods for CWS. 
Experimental results on Bakeoff-2005 
database show that SOM-based features 
can contribute more than 7% relative 
error reduction, and the structured SVM 
method for CWS proposed in this paper 
also outperforms traditional conditional 
random field (CRF) method.
