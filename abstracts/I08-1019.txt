A pair of sentences in different newspaper
articles on an event can have one of sev-
eral relations. Of these, we have focused on
two, i.e., equivalence and transition. Equiv-
alence is the relation between two sentences
that have the same information on an event.
Transition is the relation between two sen-
tences that have the same information except
for values of numeric attributes. We pro-
pose methods of identifying these relations.
We first split a dataset consisting of pairs
of sentences into clusters according to their
similarities, and then construct a classifier
for each cluster to identify equivalence re-
lations. We also adopt a ?coarse-to-fine? ap-
proach. We further propose using the identi-
fied equivalence relations to address the task
of identifying transition relations.
