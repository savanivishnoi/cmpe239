 
We suggest a new goal and evaluation criterion for 
word similarity measures. The new criterion - 
meaning-entailing substitutability - fits the needs 
of semantic-oriented NLP applications and can be 
evaluated directly (independent of an application) 
at a good level of human agreement. Motivated by 
this semantic criterion we analyze the empirical 
quality of distributional word feature vectors and 
its impact on word similarity results, proposing an 
objective measure for evaluating feature vector 
quality. Finally, a novel feature weighting and se-
lection function is presented, which yields superior 
feature vectors and better word similarity perform-
ance.
