In this paper, we propose a three-step 
multilingual dependency parser, which 
generalizes an efficient parsing algorithm 
at first phase, a root parser and post-
processor at the second and third stages. 
The main focus of our work is to provide 
an efficient parser that is practical to use 
with combining only lexical and part-of-
speech features toward language inde-
pendent parsing. The experimental results 
show that our method outperforms Malt-
parser in 13 languages. We expect that 
such an efficient model is applicable for 
most languages.
