 
Feature and context aggregation play a 
large role in current NER systems, allowing 
significant opportunities for research into op-
timizing these features to cater to different 
domains. This work strives to reduce the noise 
introduced into aggregated features from dis-
parate and generic training data in order to al-
low for contextual features that more closely 
model the entities in the target data. The pro-
posed approach trains models based on only a 
part of the training set that is more similar to 
the target domain. To this end, models are 
trained for an existing NER system using the 
top documents from the training set that are 
similar to the target document in order to 
demonstrate that this technique can be applied 
to improve any pre-built NER system. Initial 
results show an improvement over the Univer-
sity of Illinois NE tagger with a weighted av-
erage F1 score of 91.67 compared to the 
Illinois tagger?s score of 91.32. This research 
serves as a proof-of-concept for future 
planned work to cluster the training docu-
ments to produce a number of more focused 
models from a given training set, thereby re-
ducing noise and extracting a more repre-
sentative feature set.
