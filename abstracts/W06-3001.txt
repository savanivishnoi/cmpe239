Considering data obtained from a corpus
of database QA dialogues, we address the
nature of the discourse structure needed
to resolve the several kinds of contextual
phenomena found in our corpus. We look
at the thematic relations holding between
questions and the preceding context and
discuss to which extent thematic related-
ness plays a role in discourse structure.
