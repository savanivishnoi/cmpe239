We present a principled approach to the problem of con-
necting a controlled document authoring system with a
knowledge base. We start by describing closed-world au-
thoring situations, in which the knowledge base is used
for constraining the possible documents and orienting the
user?s selections. Then we move to open-world author-
ing situations in which, additionally, choices made dur-
ing authoring are echoed back to the knowledge base. In
this way the information implicitly encoded in a docu-
ment becomes explicit in the knowledge base and can be
re-exploited for simplifying the authoring of new doc-
uments. We show how a Datalog KB is sufficient for
the closed-world situation, while a Description Logic KB
is better-adapted to the more complex open-world situ-
ation. All along, we pay special attention to logically
sound solutions and to decidability issues in the different
processes.
