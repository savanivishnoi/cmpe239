Within the SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise, the
TempEval-3 shared task aims to advance research
on temporal information processing. It follows on
from TempEval-1 and -2, with: a three-part struc-
ture covering temporal expression, event, and tem-
poral relation extraction; a larger dataset; and new
single measures to rank systems ? in each task and in
general. In this paper, we describe the participants?
approaches, results, and the observations from the
results, which may guide future research in this area.
