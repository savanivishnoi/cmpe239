 
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is one of 
the main challenges in Computational 
Linguistics. TreeMatch is a WSD system 
originally developed using data from SemEval 
2007 Task 7 (Coarse-grained English All-
words Task) that has been adapted for use in 
SemEval 2010 Task 17 (All-words Word 
Sense Disambiguation on a Specific Domain). 
The system is based on a fully unsupervised 
method using dependency knowledge drawn 
from a domain specific knowledge base that 
was built for this task. When evaluated on the 
task, the system precision performs above the 
First Sense Baseline.
