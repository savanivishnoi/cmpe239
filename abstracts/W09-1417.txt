 
This paper reports on a system developed for 
the BioNLP'09 shared task on detection and 
characterisation of biomedical events. Event 
triggers and types were recognised using a 
conditional random field classifier and a set of 
rules, while event participants were identified 
using a rule-based system that relied on rela-
tive distances between candidate entities and 
the trigger in the associated parse tree. The re-
sults on previously unseen test data were en-
couraging: for non-regulatory events, the F-
score was almost 50% (with precision above 
60%), with the overall F-score of around 30% 
(49% precision). The performance on more 
complex regulatory events was poor  
(F-measure of 7%). Among the 24 teams 
submitting the test results, our results were 
ranked 12th for the overall F-score and 8th for 
the F-score of non-regulation events.
