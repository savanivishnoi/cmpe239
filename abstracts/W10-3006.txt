In this paper we describe the machine
learning systems that we submitted to the
CoNLL-2010 Shared Task on Learning to
Detect Hedges and Their Scope in Nat-
ural Language Text. Task 1 on detect-
ing uncertain information was performed
by an SVM-based system to process the
Wikipedia data and by a memory-based
system to process the biological data.
Task 2 on resolving in-sentence scopes of
hedge cues, was performed by a memory-
based system that relies on information
from syntactic dependencies. This system
scored the highest F1 (57.32) of Task 2.
