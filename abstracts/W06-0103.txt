An HMM-based Single Character
Recovery (SCR) Model is proposed in
this paper to extract a large set of
?atomic abbreviation pairs?from a large
text corpus. By an ?atomic abbreviation
pair,?it refers to an abbreviated word
and its root word (i.e., unabbreviated
form) in which the abbreviation is a
single Chinese character.
This task is interesting since the
abbreviation process for Chinese
compound words seems to be
?compositional?; in other words, one
can often decode an abbreviated word,
such as ????(Taiwan University),
character-by-character back to its root
form. With a large atomic abbreviation
dictionary, one may be able to recover
multiple-character abbreviations more
easily.
With only a few training iterations, the
acquisition accuracy of the proposed
SCR model achieves 62% and 50 %
precision for training set and test set,
respectively, from the ASWSC-2001
corpus.
