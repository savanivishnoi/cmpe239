 
This paper presents the task definition, re-
sources, and the single participant system 
for Task 12: Turkish Lexical Sample Task 
(TLST), which was organized in the Se-
mEval-2007 evaluation exercise. The 
methodology followed for developing the 
specific linguistic resources necessary for 
the task has been described in this context. 
A language-specific feature set was defined 
for Turkish. TLST consists of three pieces 
of data: The dictionary, the training data, 
and the evaluation data. Finally, a single 
system that utilizes a simple statistical 
method was submitted for the task and 
evaluated.
