We report ongoing work on the development
of agents that can implicitly coordinate with
their partners in referential tasks, taking as a
case study colour terms. We describe algo-
rithms for generation and resolution of colour
descriptions and report results of experiments
on how humans use colour terms for reference
in production and comprehension.
