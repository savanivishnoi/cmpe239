 
Since early 1998, the European Telematics 
project MATE has worked towards 
facilitating re-use of annotated spoken 
language data, addressing theoretical issues 
and implementing practical solutions which 
could serve as standards in the field. The 
resulting MATE Workbench for corpus 
annotation is now available as licensed open 
source software. 
This paper describes the MATE markup 
framework which bridges between the 
theoretical and the practical activities of 
MATE and is proposed as a standard for the 
definition and representation f markup for 
spoken dialogue corpora. We also present 
early experience from use of the framework.
