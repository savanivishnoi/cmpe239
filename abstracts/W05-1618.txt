Instructional texts consist of sequences of instruc-
tions designed in order to reach an objective. The
author or the generator of instructional texts must
follow a number of principles to guarantee that the
text is of any use. Similarly, a user must follow
step by step the instructions in order to reach the
results expected. In this paper, we explore facets of
instructional texts: general prototypical structures,
rhetorical structure and natural argumentation. Our
study is based on an extensive corpus study with
the aim of generating such texts.
