We show that we can automatically clas-
sify semantically related phrases into 10
classes. Classification robustness is im-
proved by training with multiple sources
of evidence, including within-document
cooccurrence, HTML markup, syntactic
relationships in sentences, substitutability
in query logs, and string similarity. Our
work provides a benchmark for automatic
n-way classification into WordNet?s se-
mantic classes, both on a TREC news cor-
pus and on a corpus of substitutable search
query phrases.
