Computing precision and recall metrics for named
entity tagging and resolution involves classifying
text spans as true positives, false positives, or false
negatives. There are many factors that make this
classification complicated for real world systems.
We describe an evaluation system that attempts to
control this complexity through a set of rules and a
forward chaining inference engine.
