 
Gene names and symbols are important 
biomedical entities, but are highly 
ambiguous. This ambiguity affects the 
performance of both information extraction 
and information retrieval systems in the 
biomedical domain. Existing knowledge 
sources contain different types of 
information about genes and could be used 
to disambiguate gene symbols. In this 
paper, we applied an information retrieval 
(IR) based method for human gene symbol 
disambiguation and studied different 
methods to combine various types of 
information from available knowledge 
sources. Results showed that a combination 
of evidence usually improved performance. 
The combination method using coefficients 
obtained from a logistic regression model 
reached the highest precision of 92.2% on a 
testing set of ambiguous human gene 
symbols.
