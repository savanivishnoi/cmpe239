We describe a number of techniques for auto-
matically deriving lists of common and proper
nouns, and show that the distinction between
the two can be made automatically using a
vector space model learning algorithm. We
present a direct evaluation on the British Na-
tional Corpus, and application based evalua-
tions on Twitter messages and on automatic
speech recognition (where the system could be
employed to restore case).
