The literature contains a wealth of theoretical and empirical anal-
yses of discourse marker functions in human communication. Some of
these studies address the phenomenon that discourse markers are often
multifunctional in a given context, but do not study this in systematic
and formal ways. In this paper we show that the use of multiple dimen-
sions in distinguishing and annotating semantic units supports a more
accurate analysis of the meaning of discourse markers. We present an
empirically-based analysis of the semantic functions of discourse mark-
ers in dialogue. We demonstrate that the multiple functions, which a
discourse marker may have, are automatically recognizable from utter-
ance surface-features using machine-learning techniques.
