Domain adaptation has recently gained
interest in statistical machine translation
to cope with the performance drop ob-
served when testing conditions deviate
from training conditions. The basic idea
is that in-domain training data can be ex-
ploited to adapt all components of an al-
ready developed system. Previous work
showed small performance gains by adapt-
ing from limited in-domain bilingual data.
Here, we aim instead at significant per-
formance gains by exploiting large but
cheap monolingual in-domain data, either
in the source or in the target language.
We propose to synthesize a bilingual cor-
pus by translating the monolingual adap-
tation data into the counterpart language.
Investigations were conducted on a state-
of-the-art phrase-based system trained on
the Spanish?English part of the UN cor-
pus, and adapted on the corresponding
Europarl data. Translation, re-ordering,
and language models were estimated after
translating in-domain texts with the base-
line. By optimizing the interpolation of
these models on a development set the
BLEU score was improved from 22.60%
to 28.10% on a test set.
