This paper develops a method for recognizing rela-
tions and entities in sentences, while taking mutual
dependencies among them into account. E.g., the kill
(Johns, Oswald) relation in: ?J. V. Oswald was
murdered at JFK after his assassin,
K. F. Johns...? depends on identifying Oswald
and Johns as people, JFK being identified as a location,
and the kill relation between Oswald and Johns; this, in
turn, enforces that Oswald and Johns are people.
In our framework, classifiers that identify entities and
relations among them are first learned from local infor-
mation in the sentence; this information, along with con-
straints induced among entity types and relations, is used
to perform global inference that accounts for the mutual
dependencies among the entities.
Our preliminary experimental results are promising
and show that our global inference approach improves
over learning relations and entities separately.
