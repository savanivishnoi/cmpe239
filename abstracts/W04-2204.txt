In this paper, we show how to construct a
transfer dictionary automatically. Dictionary
construction, one of the most difficult tasks
in developing a machine translation system, is
expensive. To avoid this problem, we investi-
gate how we build a dictionary using existing
linguistic resources. Our algorithm can be ap-
plied to any language pairs, but for the present
we focus on building a Korean-to-Japanese
dictionary using English as a pivot. We
attempt three ways of automatic construction
to corroborate the effect of the directionality
of dictionaries. First, we introduce ?one-time
look up?method using a Korean-to-English and
a Japanese-to-English dictionary. Second, we
show a method using ?overlapping constraint?
with a Korean-to-English dictionary and an
English-to-Japanese dictionary. Third, we con-
sider another alternative method rarely used
for building a dictionary: an English-to-Korean
dictionary and English-to-Japanese dictionary.
We found that the first method is the most
effective and the best result can be obtained
from combining the three methods.
