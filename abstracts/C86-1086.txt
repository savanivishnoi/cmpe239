 
A new Theory of Names and Descriptions that offers a uniform 
treatment for many types of non-singular concepts found in natural 
language discourse is presented. We introduce a layered model of the 
language denotational base (the universe) in which every world object 
Js assagned a layer (level) reflecting its relative singularity with respect 
tn other objects in the universe, We define the notion of relative 
singularity of world objects as an abstraction class of the layer- 
membership relation
