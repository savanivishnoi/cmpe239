 
We present a system submitted in the Semantic 
Textual Similarity (STS) task at the Second 
Joint Conference on Lexical and Computa-
tional Semantics (*SEM 2013). Given two 
short text fragments, the goal of the system is 
to determine their semantic similarity. Our sys-
tem makes use of three different measures of 
text similarity: word n-gram overlap, character 
n-gram overlap and semantic overlap. Using 
these measures as features, it trains a support 
vector regression model on SemEval STS 2012 
data. This model is then applied on the STS 
2013 data to compute textual similarities. Two 
different selections of training data result in 
very different performance levels: while a cor-
relation of 0.4135 with gold standards was ob-
served in the official evaluation (ranked 63rd 
among all systems) for one selection, the other 
resulted in a correlation of 0.5352 (that would 
rank 21st).
