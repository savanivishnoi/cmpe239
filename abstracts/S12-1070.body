This paper describes the Duluth systems that
participated in Task 2 of SemEval?2012.
These systems were unsupervised and relied
on variations of the Gloss Vector measure
found in the freely available software pack-
age WordNet::Similarity. This method was
moderately successful for the Class-Inclusion,
Similar, Contrast, and Non-Attribute cate-
gories of semantic relations, but mimicked a
random baseline for the other six categories.
