We propose a new semantic orientation, Ex-
citation, and its automatic acquisition method.
Excitation is a semantic property of predicates
that classifies them into excitatory, inhibitory
and neutral. We show that Excitation is useful
for extracting contradiction pairs (e.g., destroy
cancer ? develop cancer) and causality pairs
(e.g., increase in crime ? heighten anxiety).
Our experiments show that with automatically
acquired Excitation knowledge we can extract
one million contradiction pairs and 500,000
causality pairs with about 70% precision from
a 600 million page Web corpus. Furthermore,
by combining these extracted causality and
contradiction pairs, we can generate one mil-
lion plausible causality hypotheses that are not
written in any single sentence in our corpus
with reasonable precision.
