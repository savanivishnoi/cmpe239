Most dialog systems explicitly confirm
user-provided task-relevant concepts.
User responses to these system confirma-
tions (e.g. corrections, topic changes) may
be misrecognized because they contain
unrequested task-related concepts. In this
paper, we propose a concept-specific lan-
guage model adaptation strategy where
the language model (LM) is adapted to
the concept type(s) actually present in
the user?s post-confirmation utterance.
We evaluate concept type classification
and LM adaptation for post-confirmation
utterances in the Let?s Go! dialog system.
We achieve 93% accuracy on concept type
classification using acoustic, lexical and
dialog history features. We also show that
the use of concept type classification for
LM adaptation can lead to improvements
in speech recognition performance.
