 
The more Chinese language materials come 
out, the more we have to focus on the ?same 
personal name? problem. In our personal 
name disambiguation system, the hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering is applied, and 
named entity is used as feature for document 
similarity calculation. We propose a two-stage 
strategy in which the first stage involves word 
segmentation and named entity recognition 
(NER) for feature extraction, and the second 
stage focuses on clustering.
