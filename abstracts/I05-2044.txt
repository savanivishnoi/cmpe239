 
In the Chinese language, a verb may 
have its dependents on its left, right or on 
both sides. The ambiguity resolution of 
right-side dependencies is essential for de-
pendency parsing of sentences with two or 
more verbs. Previous works on shift-
reduce dependency parsers may not guar-
antee the connectivity of a dependency tree 
due to their weakness at resolving the 
right-side dependencies. This paper pro-
poses a two-phase shift-reduce dependency 
parser based on SVM learning. The left-
side dependents and right-side nominal de-
pendents are detected in Phase I, and right-
side verbal dependents are decided in 
Phase II. In experimental evaluation, our 
proposed method outperforms previous 
shift-reduce dependency parsers for the 
Chine language, showing improvement of 
dependency accuracy by 10.08%.
