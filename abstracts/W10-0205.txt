Since paraphrasing is one of the crucial tasks
in natural language understanding and gener-
ation, this paper introduces a novel technique
to extract paraphrases for emotion terms, from
non-parallel corpora. We present a bootstrap-
ping technique for identifying paraphrases,
starting with a small number of seeds. Word-
Net Affect emotion words are used as seeds.
The bootstrapping approach learns extraction
patterns for six classes of emotions. We use
annotated blogs and other datasets as texts
from which to extract paraphrases, based on
the highest-scoring extraction patterns. The
results include lexical and morpho-syntactic
paraphrases, that we evaluate with human
judges.
