The Semantic Textual Similarity (STS)
task aims to exam the degree of semantic
equivalence between sentences (Agirre et
al., 2012). This paper presents the work
of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University
(PolyUCOMP) team which has participated
in the STS core and typed tasks of SemEval-
2013. For the STS core task, the PolyUCOMP
system disambiguates words senses using
contexts and then determine sentence
similarity by counting the number of senses
they shared. For the STS typed task, the string
kernel (Lodhi et al, 2002) is used to compute
similarity between two entities to avoid string
variations in entities.
