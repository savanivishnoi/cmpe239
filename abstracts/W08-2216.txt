There has recently been a great deal of work aimed at trying to extract
information from substantial texts for tasks such as question answering.
Much of this work has dealt with texts which are reasonably large, but
which are known to contain reliable relevant information, e.g. FAQ lists,
on-line encyclopaedias, rather than looking at huge unorganised resources
such as the web. We believe, however, that even this work underestimates
the complexity and subtlety of language, and hence will inevitably be
restricted in what it can cope with. In particular, everyday use of lan-
guage involves considerable amounts of reasoning over intensional ob-
jects (properties and propositions). In order to respond appropriately to
simple-seeming questions such as ?Is going for a walk good for me??, for
instance, you have to be able to talk about event-types, which are intrinsi-
cally intensional. We discuss the issues involved in handling such items,
and shows the kind of background knowledge that is required for drawing
the appropriate conclusions about them.
