 
This work presents the tentative version of the 
protocol designed for annotation of a Russian 
metaphor corpus using the rapid annotation 
tool BRAT. 
The first part of the article is devoted to the 
procedure of "shallow" annotation in which 
metaphor-related words are identified 
according to a slightly modified version of the 
MIPVU procedure. The paper presents the 
results of two reliability tests and the measures 
of inter-annotator agreement obtained in them. 
Further on, the article gives a brief account of 
the linguistic problems that were encountered 
in adapting MIPVU to Russian. The rest of the 
first part describes the classes of metaphor-
related words and the rules of their annotation 
with BRAT. The examples of annotation show 
how the visualization functionalities of BRAT 
allow the researcher to describe the 
multifaceted nature of metaphor related words 
and the complexity of their relations. 
The second part of the paper speaks about the 
annotation of conceptual metaphors (the "deep" 
annotation), where formulations of conceptual 
metaphors are inferred from the basic and 
contextual meanings of metaphor-related words 
from the "shallow" annotation, which is 
expected to make the metaphor formulation 
process more controllable.
