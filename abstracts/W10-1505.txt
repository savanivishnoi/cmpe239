This paper introduces Web1T5-Easy, a sim-
ple indexing solution that allows interactive
searches of the Web 1T 5-gram database and
a derived database of quasi-collocations. The
latter is validated against co-occurrence data
from the BNC and ukWaC on the automatic
identification of non-compositional VPC.
