This paper discusses a planner of the semantics of utterances, whose essential
design is an epistemic theorem prover. The planner was designed for the purpose
of planning communicative actions, whose effects are famously unknowable and
unobservable by the doer/speaker, and depend on the beliefs of and inferences made
by the recipient/hearer. The fully implemented model can achieve goals that do
not match action effects, but that are rather entailed by them, which it does by
reasoning about how to act: state-space planning is interwoven with theorem proving
in such a way that a theorem prover uses the effects of actions as hypotheses. The
planner is able to model problematic conversational situations, including felicitous
and infelicitous instances of bluffing, lying, sarcasm, and stating the obvious. 1
