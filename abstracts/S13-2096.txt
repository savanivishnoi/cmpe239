In this paper the UNITOR-HMM-TK system
participating in the Spatial Role Labeling
task at SemEval 2013 is presented. The
spatial roles classification is addressed as a
sequence-based word classification problem:
the SVMhmm learning algorithm is applied,
based on a simple feature modeling and a ro-
bust lexical generalization achieved through a
Distributional Model of Lexical Semantics. In
the identification of spatial relations, roles are
combined to generate candidate relations, later
verified by a SVM classifier. The Smoothed
Partial Tree Kernel is applied, i.e. a con-
volution kernel that enhances both syntactic
and lexical properties of the examples, avoid-
ing the need of a manual feature engineering
phase. Finally, results on three of the five tasks
of the challenge are reported.
