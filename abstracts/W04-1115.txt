Automatic topic segmentation, separation of a dis-
course stream into its constituent stories or topics,
is a necessary preprocessing step for applications
such as information retrieval, anaphora resolution,
and summarization. While significant progress has
been made in this area for text sources and for En-
glish audio sources, little work has been done in
automatic, acoustic feature-based segmentation of
other languages. In this paper, we consider exploit-
ing both prosodic and text-based features for topic
segmentation of Mandarin Chinese. As a tone lan-
guage, Mandarin presents special challenges for ap-
plicability of intonation-based techniques, since the
pitch contour is also used to establish lexical iden-
tity. We demonstrate that intonational cues such as
reduction in pitch and intensity at topic boundaries
and increase in duration and pause still provide sig-
nificant contrasts in Mandarin Chinese. We build
a decision tree classifier that, based only on word
and local context prosodic information without ref-
erence to term similarity, cue phrase, or sentence-
level information, achieves boundary classification
accuracy of 84.6-95.6% on a balanced test set. We
contrast these results with classification using text-
based features, exploiting both text similarity and
n-gram cues, to achieve accuracies between 77-
95.6%, if silence features are used. Finally we in-
tegrate prosody, text, and silence features using a
voting strategy to combine decision tree classifiers
for each feature subset individually and all subsets
jointly. This voted decision tree classifier yields
an overall classification accuracy of 96.85%, with
2.8% miss and 3.15% false alarm rates on a repre-
sentative corpus sample, demonstrating synergistic
combination of prosodic and text features for topic
segmentation.
