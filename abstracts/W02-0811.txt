This paper discusses ensembles of simple but het-
erogeneous classifiers for word-sense disambigua-
tion, examining the Stanford-CS224N system en-
tered in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample
task. First-order classifiers are combined by a
second-order classifier, which variously uses ma-
jority voting, weighted voting, or a maximum en-
tropy model. While individual first-order classifiers
perform comparably to middle-scoring teams? sys-
tems, the combination achieves high performance.
We discuss trade-offs and empirical performance.
Finally, we present an analysis of the combination,
examining how ensemble performance depends on
error independence and task difficulty.
