We describe our language-independent un-
supervised word sense induction system.
This system only uses topic features to
cluster different word senses in their global
context topic space. Using unlabeled data,
this system trains a latent Dirichlet alo-
cation (LDA) topic model then uses it to
infer the topics distribution of the test in-
stances. By clustering these topics dis-
tributions in their topic space we cluster
them into different senses. Our hypothesis
is that closeness in topic space reflects sim-
ilarity between different word senses. This
system participated in SemEval-2 word
sense induction and disambiguation task
and achieved the second highest V-measure
score among all other systems.
