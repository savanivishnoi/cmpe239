This paper describes methods that were sub-
mitted as part of the *SEM shared task on
Semantic Textual Similarity. Multiple kernels
provide different views of syntactic structure,
from both tree and dependency parses. The
kernels are then combined with simple lex-
ical features using Gaussian process regres-
sion, which is trained on different subsets of
training data for each run. We found that the
simplest combination has the highest consis-
tency across the different data sets, while in-
troduction of more training data and models
requires training and test data with matching
qualities.
