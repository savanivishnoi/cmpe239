 
In this paper we highlight a selection of 
features of scientific text which distinguish it 
from news stories. We argue that features such 
as structure, selective use of past tense, voice 
and stylistic conventions can affect question 
answering in the scientific domain. We 
demonstrate this through qualitative 
observations made while working on 
retrieving definitions to terms related to 
salmon fish.
