The paper describes a method for identifying
and translating multiword expressions using a
bi-directional dictionary. While a dictionary-
based approach suffers from limited recall,
precision is high; hence it is best employed
alongside an approach with complementing
properties, such as an n-gram language model.
We evaluate the method on data from the
English-German translation part of the cross-
lingual word sense disambiguation task in the
2010 semantic evaluation exercise (SemEval).
The output of a baseline disambiguation sys-
tem based on n-grams was substantially im-
proved by matching the target words and their
immediate contexts against compound and
collocational words in a dictionary.
