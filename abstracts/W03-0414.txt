We describe an approach to tagging a monolin-
gual dictionary with linguistic features. In par-
ticular, we annotate the dictionary entries with
parts of speech, number, and tense information.
The algorithm uses a bilingual corpus as well
as a statistical lexicon to find candidate train-
ing examples for specific feature values (e.g.
plural). Then a similarity measure in the space
defined by the training data serves to define a
classifier for unseen data. We report evaluation
results for a French dictionary, while the ap-
proach is general enough to be applied to any
language pair.
In a further step, we show that the proposed
framework can be used to assign linguistic
roles to extracted morphemes, e.g. noun plu-
ral markers. While the morphemes can be
extracted using any algorithm, we present a
simple algorithm for doing so. The emphasis
hereby is not on the algorithm itself, but on the
power of the framework to assign roles, which
are ultimately indispensable for tasks such as
Machine Translation.
