  
In this paper, we propose a new idea for 
the automatic recognition of domain 
specific terms. Our idea is based on the 
statistics between a compound noun and 
its component single-nouns. More 
precisely, we focus basically on how 
many nouns adjoin the noun in question 
to form compound nouns. We propose 
several scoring methods based on this 
idea and experimentally evaluate them on 
the NTCIR1 TMREC test collection. The 
results are very promising especially in 
the low recall area.
