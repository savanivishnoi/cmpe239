A novel technique for maximum ?a posteriori?
(MAP) adaptation of maximum entropy (MaxEnt)
and maximum entropy Markov models (MEMM) is
presented.
The technique is applied to the problem of recov-
ering the correct capitalization of uniformly cased
text: a ?background? capitalizer trained on 20Mwds
of Wall Street Journal (WSJ) text from 1987 is
adapted to two Broadcast News (BN) test sets ?
one containing ABC Primetime Live text and the
other NPR Morning News/CNN Morning Edition
text ? from 1996.
The ?in-domain? performance of the WSJ capi-
talizer is 45% better than that of the 1-gram base-
line, when evaluated on a test set drawn from WSJ
1994. When evaluating on the mismatched ?out-of-
domain? test data, the 1-gram baseline is outper-
formed by 60%; the improvement brought by the
adaptation technique using a very small amount of
matched BN data ? 25-70kwds ? is about 20-25%
relative. Overall, automatic capitalization error rate
of 1.4% is achieved on BN data.
