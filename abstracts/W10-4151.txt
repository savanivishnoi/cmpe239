 
This paper describes a complete syntactic 
analysis system based on multi-level 
chunking. On the basis of the correct se-
quences of Chinese words provided by 
CLP2010, the system firstly has a Part-of-
speech (POS) tagging with Conditional 
Random Fields (CRFs), and then does the 
base chunking and complex chunking with 
Maximum Entropy (ME), and finally gene-
rates a complete syntactic analysis tree. 
The system took part in the Complete Sen-
tence Parsing Track of the Task 2 Chinese 
Parsing in CLP2010, achieved the F-1 
measure of 63.25% on the overall analysis, 
ranked the sixth; POS accuracy rate of 
89.62%, ranked the third.
